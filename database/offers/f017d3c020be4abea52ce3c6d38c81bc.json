  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Bring a breath of fresh air into the restaurant business with Dine Out DLC! Renovate a wide variety of establishments.\n<!--text-->\nDine Out DLC will let you get your foot in the door of the restaurant business. It comes with a set of engaging, immersive quests that will allow you to explore and renovate a variety of restaurants, cafes, sushi bars, wine cellars and pizzerias. The DLC also introduces numerous new items, mechanics and other features that will make your House Flipper experience more fun and comfortable.\n\n**Let them rent!**\n\nHouse Flipper has always enabled you to buy and sell properties, but now we're unlocking the opportunity for long-term profit-making! Choose from residential properties, restaurants, cafes, or offices, and lease your freshly renovated spaces. The rental price depends on the number of rooms, furnishings and the type of property – choose a tenant that suits you and sign the contract.\n\n**Universal Cooker – One Click, and It's Ready!**\n\nAs with previous House Flipper DLCs, Dine Out comes with new tools to play with. One of them is the Universal Cooker – a multifunctional device that will let you spread your wings in the restaurant business both as a flipper and a chef. Have a taste for Thai cuisine? Or maybe you have a soft spot for some Italian classics? Pick and choose from our extensive list of diverse dishes and design the menu of your restaurant. Purchase the ingredients and wait as the magical Universal Cooker does its job! Dishes prepared with the Universal Cooker can be later used as delicious pieces of decor. And if you own our previous add-on (Farm DLC), you can get discounts on some of the dishes depending on the crops you have in your inventory.\n\n**More precision to stop collision!**\n\nA well-planned and decorated interior and elegant table setting are all factors when it comes to customer satisfaction. If you feel you might need a little help getting the establishment ready for a steady influx of demanding clientele, we recommend you take a look at our new grid measurement system. Buy in bulk and place items exactly where they need to be. The new tool that comes with Dine Out DLC allows you to keep everything as symmetrical as you'd like. Being a perfectionist has never been easier!\n\n**Cook up your own style**\n\nMake sure your establishment becomes an institution thanks to an iconic restaurant sign. Dine Out DLC comes with a tool that allows you to customize the logo of your restaurant with a plethora of shapes, fonts, colors and patterns. Mix it up, experiment, or keep it simple – there is no single recipe for success.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- 10 engaging and immersive quests\n- 10 houses to renovate and decorate\n- 30 dishes from around the world to prepare\n- The ability to rent out restaurants, offices and houses\n- New, more precise tool for furniture grid measurement system!\n- The ability to decorate kitchen tables with tablecloths\n- The ability to design your own advertising signs\n- Over 1350 new items!\n",
