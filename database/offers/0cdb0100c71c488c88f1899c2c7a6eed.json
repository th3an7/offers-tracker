  "description": "BUNDLE: Yomi 2 + Renegades expansion.\n\nA fighting game in card form. Learn your character, practice combos, and read the opponent's tendencies. Strategic, turn-based card battling that lets you experience the nuances of fighting games like Street Fighter and Fantasy Strike.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# BUNDLE\n<!--text-->\nNote: This bundle contains the Yomi 2 base game, and its Renegades expansion.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# OVERVIEW\n<!--text-->\nYomi 2 is a fighting card game. Pick your character deck, pick a gem to augment them, and fight an opponent. Like in a fighting game, you’ll block high and low attacks, throw overly defensive players, and perform combos of several attacks in a row.\n\nYomi 2 refines this concept over the original game with several new mechanics, such as gems to alter your character, knockdowns that allow high/low mixups, the ability to “gain the edge” to speed up your attacks, and a system to exchange cards in your hand with cards in your discard pile so you can build the hand you want.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# WHAT’S NEW AND COOL ABOUT YOMI 2\n<!--text-->\n### Fighting System\n\n- Exchange! You can exchange a card in your hand with one in your discard pile each turn as long as both have the exchange symbol. Will you use this to build stronger combos or to cover your weaknesses?\n\n- Gems. Pick a gem to augment your character. Each gem gives you different special moves and abilities as well as a once-per-game \"gem storm\" that can turn the tides to your favor.\n\n- High and low attacks. Just like in a fighting game, some attacks must be blocked high while others must be blocked low. These “mixups” are especially effective if your opponent is knocked down.\n\n- Projectiles. “Zoner” characters can build up their hand size while throwing relatively low risk fireball-type moves.\n\n- Super moves. Build up super meter that you can spend on powerful super moves. To get super meter, you can discard pairs or you can land \"chain combos\" of consecutive attacks.\n\n### Features\n- 9 characters at early access launch, many more planned to be added for free.\n\n- 6 gems to augment characters.\n\n- Single player career mode where you visit numerous card-playing venues, fight regulars, compete in tournaments, and try to become the best Yomi player in the city. (And the most popular on fake social media!) Huge mode, only a small portion available at early access launch, more to roll out over time.\n\n- Single player vs AI with four difficulty levels.\n\n- Online synchronous play (at launch) as well as asynchronous play (to be added during the early access period).\n\n- Pass-and-play mode for local play against a friend.\n\n- Tutorial to get you started.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# RENEGADES EXPANSION\n<!--text-->\nTroq, the well-meaning beast, has changed loyalties several times. River Montoya, the dancing fencer, has been stirring up trouble and building a band of rebels. These renegades are now yours to command in Yomi 2, along with powerful new gems.\n\nExpansion includes:\n• Two new playable characters (Troq and River)\n• Two new gems, useable by any character (Orange and Diamond)\n• Use any of the unlockable \"wacky rulesets\" from Career Mode in online friend matches.\n",
