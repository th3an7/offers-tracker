  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Take up your weapon, fight alongside gods, and change fate itself in Titan Quest II, an action RPG inspired by Greek mythology.\n<!--text-->\nReturn to the classic mythology-inspired setting of Titan Quest and go toe-to-toe with legendary monsters as you journey across a fantastical reimagining of ancient Greece.\n\nNemesis, Goddess of Retribution, is out of control. She is corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including you. Take up your weapon, fight alongside gods, and change fate itself in order to stop Nemesis, free those she’s punished, and weave your own epic tale.\n\nFrom the creators of SpellForce 3 comes a handcrafted action RPG for a new generation of mythical heroes.\n\n**A World of Myth and Monsters**\nSet out on an adventure worthy of myth that takes you from picturesque beaches, to serene Greek temples, to places where no mortal has ever ventured, including the mysterious realm of the Moirai themselves.\n\nBattle classic creatures from Greek myth and the original Titan Quest, including Ichthians, Centaurs, Satyrs, Harpies, Sirens, Gryphons, and many, many more. \n\n**Exploration-Focused Campaign**\nPay close attention to your surroundings! The world is full of mysteries and secrets to discover. Legendary monsters lurk in hidden groves, and you never know when you will end up face-to-face with a god.\n\nVisit memorable towns full of life and intrigue. The conversations you engage in and the items you find along your journey can lead to surprising discoveries, or they might just hold the key to stopping Nemesis. This is your adventure.\n\n**A Challenge Fit for a Hero**\nHeroic deeds require heroic effort. The enemies you face are far from defenseless - dodge and counter their attacks, then overwhelm them with a well-timed flurry of blows. \n\nPowerful rituals allow you to freely control the game’s difficulty, while deep character customization systems ensure that there’s always a good reason to replay.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Key Features\n<!--text-->\n- Flexible character system: In Titan Quest II, you are in control of your own fate.
