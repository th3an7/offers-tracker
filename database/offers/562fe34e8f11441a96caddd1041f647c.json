  "description": "L3E7 is a next-gen location-based open-world RPG where the real world becomes your battlefield.\nExplore a mirrored version of Earth powered by real-world maps. Walk, explore, and interact with your surroundings to unlock missions, claim landmarks, and engage in tactical battles.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Explore Planet L3E7\n<!--text-->\n### Map System\nL3E7 was created by the high-level civilization known as the \"Observer Collectors\" to monitor the continuous changes in Earth's buildings. To achieve this, they connected L3E7 to Earth through a particle channel, allowing real-time resonance. L3E7 was designed as a cyber-physical version of Earth, with virtual materialization technology maintaining its resemblance to Earth.\n\nThe planet's surface is no longer composed of rock and soil, and its interior is not made of mantle, core, and lava. Instead, everything is constructed from structures calculated in real-time by a cyber network, using virtual technology to create three-dimensional models and materialize them instantly. The reformed L3E7 has become a planet where virtual structures created online are materialized into existence. Everything familiar on Earth still exists but is now made of new materials and phenomena created by advanced technology, making it familiar yet strange to visitors from Earth.\n\nAs a result, people on the planet can roam and explore freely based on the capabilities provided by network and virtual signal calculations, unrestricted by physical geography. This allows them to explore the vast and diverse map system of L3E7.\n\n### Vehicle System and Cyber Treasure Chests\nOn L3E7, virtual signals and network data significantly influence the \"laws of physics,\" allowing for incredible feats like objects falling from the sky. This means people on L3E7 can use the vehicle system to easily create and obtain sci-fi vehicles still in the conceptual stage on Earth.\n\nAdditionally, there are randomly occurring cyber treasure chests containing various valuable items and recreational tools. Together with the futuristic vehicles, these elements create a scene on L3E7 where \"dreams come true.\"\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Journey with the Sympathizers\n<!--text-->\n### Acquiring and Commanding Sympathizers\nAs the Predators launch their attack, characters from the Interstellar Guardians Alliance are transmitted to L3E7 using quantum totems to assist Earth's civilization. However, due to the Predators' powerful interference, these characters are significantly weakened, including their crucial \"elemental enhancement\" abilities.\n\nTo counter this, we've developed the \"consciousness resonance\" technology, where players act as commanders and characters as team members. During resonance, both parties' consciousnesses are read and synchronized, meaning one party's thoughts, knowledge, and actions are instantly perceived and responded to by the other. For the resonating parties, there is no conflict, concealment, or information asymmetryâ€”they function as one entity. Thus, these characters are known as \"Sympathizers,\" accepting the players' command.\n\n### Enhancing Sympathizers' Abilities\nAs players use consciousness resonance to strengthen the combat abilities of their Sympathizers, Earth and the Interstellar Guardians Alliance continue to counteract the Predators' interference, gradually restoring the Sympathizers' original powers. Players can employ various methods to counteract the interference, such as leveling up Sympathizers, breaking through limits, and equipping them with gear (known as Guardian Souls) to regain their inherent strength.\n\n### Battling with Sympathizers\nTeams, with players as commanders and Sympathizers as members, participate in various battlefields on L3E7. Players must select the most suitable Sympathizers for different stages and enemies to form their squads and engage in combat to fend off adversaries.\n\nOn the battlefield, players engage in city reclamation operations, defeating \"boss\" monsters guarding each district to reclaim territory. By occupying these areas, players can continuously analyze the bosses' cores to obtain advanced technologies and items.\n\nTo minimize squad casualties, players can also undertake a series of individual simulation battle stages. These allow the player's command squad to learn detailed enemy information in advance and receive certain promotions and rewards based on the simulation results.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Meet New Friends on L3E7\n<!--text-->\nTo help players quickly adapt and thrive on L3E7, as well as rapidly equip new battle squads for the front lines, players can choose to spawn at locations that mirror their real-world geographical position. Plus, we'll organize local events based on your real-world locations to keep things lively.\n\nTo encourage teamwork and cooperation, clubs will receive extensive support. Players who join clubs and fight together will gain more benefits than those who go solo. Club participation will provide valuable resources and bonuses, boosting your overall gaming experience.\n\n<!--image-->\n![L3E7-1cndm](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/532656b054b14350baab996732ae5959/l3e7-1cndm.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![L3E7-urdot](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/532656b054b14350baab996732ae5959/l3e7-urdot.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![L3E7-l6xx7](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/532656b054b14350baab996732ae5959/l3e7-l6xx7.png)\n",
