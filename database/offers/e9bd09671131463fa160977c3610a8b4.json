All kinds of different book readings, which go nicely with the music. The Characters are A Cute Witch, A University Schoolgirl, A Valkyrie Warrior with a big attitude, Wukong, and Officer Frank.”\n\nThis game sings the song of Lucifer.\n\nThis game was made by one person,\n\nNot a huge company or a large team,\n\nOne guy.\n\nMy main competition is the FEAR AND HUNGER series,\n\nI am not intending to go toe to toe with great works like Deus Ex Human Revolution, Persona 4 & 5, Yakuza 0, Pathologic, The Shin Megami Tensei Series, Or Final Fantasy 7, which could only be made by a team of hundreds, This instead is about a single person’s vision and achievements, no boardroom no hr department approved this game, I did not censor myself, I made exactly the kind of game I always wanted to make. I am one man making my game myself so I can tell my story.\n\nI believe it is a great work of art.\n\n\n\nAlso included is a multiplayer CCG Collectable Card Game Minigame, Full of weird and bizarre cards, and an arcade shooter minigame with Tanks, Tactical Shooter, and Aerial Combat based multiplayer.\n\n\n\nPS: The maker of this game is a person with Schizophrenia,\n\nIt is my hope that if people play this game and like it,\n\nIt might improve negative perceptions people have about us.\n\nA few years ago, in 2021, my wife and I separated when she was still pregnant, at the time of writing I have not yet met my son, part of the reason we split up was because she didn’t think game design was a good career. One third of all profits from this game will be sent directly to my wife and young son.\n\nThis work is not intended to offend or upset Christians. This work is deeply rooted in Christian mythology, and I have a great admiration for the bible. I like Christians, and a Christian saved my life when I was at my worst point. Rather I just wish to tell my story. In a certain tradition, they believe Lucifer repented to God and was forgiven, and now he lives in Heaven again. I feel this is in the spirit of the Christian message, that no sin is unforgivable, and that there is no one who does not deserve kindness. This is not intended to be an attack on Christianity. It is a celebration of all religions. Inspired by the Gnostic Texts, The Philosophy of Scott Adams, and the Scott Adams Simulation Theory, The Bible, Buddhist Philosophy, informed by the Hindu religion, Deism, Norse and Roman Religion, Luciferianism and Satanism in various forms, and the teachings of Morgue. As well as modern religious philosophy found in games like the Shin Megami Tensei series.\n\nIf all goes well I hope to make an Expanded Edition/Sequel using the same game world, just adding extra content.\n\nBuilt for Challenge Runs: [Your first run determines your fortune and destination.] (HIGHER DESTINATIONS TAKE PRIORITY.)\n(A) Talk to God without cheating.
