  "longDescription": "\n# The Clan\n\nCarried by the winds, the agile explorers of Hraesvelg do not need to occupy a large territory, for they will readily venture outside to gather resources. Their profound knowledge of the terrain and their ability to exploit it to its fullest allows them to survive in the most desolate of areas. They are led by Grif, the sole survivor of a fallen clan.\n\n# The Warchief | Grif\n\nOrphaned upon the fall of their parent’s clan, Grif was adopted at a young age by the followers of Hraesvelg. This demonstration of adaptability made them a perfect leader for the Eagle clan. \n\n# Falconers, Aviaries and Hawks \n\nFalconers can be assigned to Aviaries to explore uncharted lands, releasing Hawks that will gather resources on Boneyards and assist your sentinels. Falconers can open and access Ruins or Shipwrecks and seal Wolf Dens or Draugr Tombs outside your territory.\n\n# The Relic | Vídópnir’s Feather\n\nReveals a Forbidden Cache containing great riches and equally great dangers…\n\n# Starting Bonuses\n\n- The Aviary replaces the Scout Camp. Their number is limited to 3 but they don't use a building slot. Falconers can't get hurt and collect Lore when they explore a new zone. They can explore Ruins or Shipwrecks and close Wolf Dens or Draugr Tombs outside their territory.\n\n- Cleared zones become Boneyards. For 2 months, units within the zone will be healed and Hawks will come to gather resources. The number of Hawks on a Boneyard depends on how many foes you killed in it and how many Aviaries you built.\n\n- Your Aviaries will reveal Buried Cache on the map over time.\n\n- You gain no Fame for the size of your territory.\n\n# Fame Bonuses\n\n**Nomadic Tribe | Fame 200**\n\nUnits outside their territory consume 50% less Food and Firewood. Zones can be upgraded using Food. In upgraded zones, houses give +1 population and military buildings give +1 warband.\n**\nScavenging | Fame 500**\n\nRuins, Shipwreck, and all special zones can be explored once more to gain additional resources (except the Fame). It is possible to reclaim a colonization bonus from a zone that already gave one.\n\n# Lore Tree\n\n**Foraging**\n\nYou gain 60% more resources when closing a Wolf Den, a Draugr Tomb or colonizing a zone.\n\n**Sentinel**\n\nFalconers gain Watch Keeping: The Falconer deploys his Hawk to keep watch of everything happening in the zone, improving  attack power of military units by 10% and production of allied specialized units by 15%\n\n**Rapine**\n\nThe Boneyard effect is applied to decolonized zones. All your Hawks get resources from enemy production buildings in the zone.\n\n**Training Field**\n\nYou gain +1 Happiness for each unclaimed zone adjacent to your territory with no hostile units.",
