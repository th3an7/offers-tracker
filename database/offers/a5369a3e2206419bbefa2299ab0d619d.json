  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nYou have roamed the lands of Fiara and bested every challenge, master mage. You have come far, but your imagination is still so…limited. You have not yet pierced the veil to the worlds beyond. Thousands of realms and endless possibilities await those that master the weaving.\n \nLearn to weave the magic of dreams to make them reality, grant dreams to your faithful followers and minions, and empower them with your imagination or cast far-reaching spells, weaving your web over cities and regions.\n\nBut there are new adventures and new challengers to your might beyond the Circle – a grand portal promises new worlds to conquer, an evil army on the march threatens to overpower you, and the fight against a rival wizard may consume you. Will you dare face the new threats before you?\n\nPerhaps a new hero or new apprentices may help in your endeavor, if you can bring them to your side? If not in this world, then the next or the next… or the next…\n\nThe Weaver’s Realms DLC introduces endless worlds that can be created with a simple click – your game will never be the same again.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Randomly Generated Campaign Map\n<!--text-->\nCreate a multitude of worlds with the new random map feature. Whether you want a map based on the current world lore, one that gets harder the further you go, or perhaps one that is formed differently – together with a variety of settings, enemies, heroes, and difficulty options, you can make the game what YOU want it to be.\n\nDo you want access to multiple crafting schools? A specific hero? Or even to randomize every possible factor for a surprise challenge? \n\nYou control exactly how you want the campaign to be set up!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# New Scenarios\n<!--text-->\nWant a completely new challenge that plays very differently? With three new scenario options, you can seek out a mystical portal, prepare for the invasion of a mighty enemy army, or duel an opposing wizard one-to-one. These scenarios, played on specifically generated smaller maps, change the rules of play and give you new goals to fulfill in order to triumph.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# New Spell Class: Dreamweaving\n<!--text-->\nA powerful school that harnesses the power of dreams, dealing in illusion as well as manipulation. Dreamweaving enables powerful, world-spanning spells, allowing you to instil dreams in your followers and awaken new powers and abilities within them.\n\nWith 16 new spells, and dozens of new Dream items to bind to your followers' mind slots, you can master the dreams and aspirations of those that serve you, allowing you to break the barriers of this world and achieve things thought impossible before. However, dreams are fleeting and only the most powerful mage can sustain them!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# New hero, units and items\n<!--text-->\nSpellForce: Conquest of Eo – Weaver’s Realms offers new enemy units like the goblin High Muckamuck, new apprentices, and dozens of new items and skills.\n\nSneak by your enemy with fleet-footed Burgle, the new goblin hero who will lead you on daring heists through the cities of Fiara.\n\nNew places to loot and improved Circle Mage set-ups allow for highly increased replayability, adding fresh surprises to the game.\n\n\n- Randomly generated campaign map with highly individualized settings\n- Challenge yourself in three completely new scenarios on special maps with their own goals and mechanics.\n- A new spell school: Dreamweaving\n- Lead the new goblin hero Burgle through his high adventure\n- Over a dozen new enemies, apprentices and minions\n- Over 30 new items and special dreams to equip your units with\n- New unit level up upgrades and all-new  abilities\n- Antagonists now gain spires to support their towers for a more balanced  challenge\n",
