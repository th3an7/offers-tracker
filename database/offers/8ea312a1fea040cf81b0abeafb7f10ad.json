  "description": "LaunchPad is a simple UE5 editor tool to enhance PIE (Play-In-Editor) by looking at your desktop and auto-tiling the PIE windows to best fit.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>When testing multiplayer in the editor, are you tired of having to constantly resize your PIE windows?</strong> I know I sure was! Well, now you can have your PIE and eat it too with LaunchPad! This simple editor tool will be your new best friend. Don&#39;t worry about how to fit all of your PIE clients on your display.. let LaunchPad do it for! Need 3 windows? DONE! 8? No problem* just click the button and sit back.</p><p><em>(* NOTE: some PC&#39;s might not be able to handle 8 or 10 PIE windows.. I&#39;m sure yours can.. really.. totally.. and if it can&#39;t, well it&#39;s not my fault).</em></p><p>To be honest, I typically use UEDesktop to manage my multiplayer sessions but recently, I&#39;ve been bouncing around between 2, 3 and 5 clients in PIE and it was always a pain to switch back and forth, move the windows so they didn&#39;t overlap or weren&#39;t too small! So I took some time, pulled the window sizing code out of UEDesktop and created LaunchPad. Hopefully you find it useful. I know myself and others on my team sure did.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/support-launchpad-for-pie-a-simple-yet-super-useful-editor-ehancement-for-ue5/1214907\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here for the Forum Support Thread</a></p>",
