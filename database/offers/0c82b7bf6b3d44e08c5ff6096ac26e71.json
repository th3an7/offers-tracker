It is performant, contains several options for easy customization and use, and is driven by Gameplay Tags to control the effects and main settings.</p>",

I would expect there to be little to no code refactoring to allow for targeting any engine platform. If I get additional environments to test, I will try to add official support for other platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p>The same goes for Unreal Engine version 5.0. Earlier versions than 5.1 will not be officially supported, but should be trivial to re-architecture if needed for your project, if you choose to try using this with a previous version. I do plan on officially supporting all future versions of the engine.</p>",
