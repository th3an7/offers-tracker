  "longDescription": "**TSW Compatible content released for a previous Train Sim World® - features may remain unchanged from the original release and may not make use of all newer core features.\n**\n\nTake a trip to the late 2000s and experience frequent regional passenger and heavy freight services, be in control of classic and modern traction as you traverse through the heart of Northern Germany. Electric Containers and n-Wagens await in Train Sim World 3: Bahnstrecke Bremen - Oldenburg.\n\nIconic in every right, the aerodynamic DB BR 110.3 makes its debut in Train Sim World 3. A 1950s classic, the DB BR 110.3 is a former express passenger locomotive which in more recent times, runs more local and regional traffic. Twinned with the “Crease” is the retro n-Wagen, a single-deck fleet of passenger coaches complete with Karlsruher Kopf cab car, allowing for push and pull duties on the line.\n\nAccompanying the flavourful classic is a taste of modern, with additional services carried out by the sleek DB BR 425 in shiny new condition. Supporting in the role of freight is the unmistakable BR 155, sporting the flashy azure tones of PRESS – a railway company which takes on contracted cargo roles throughout Germany and beyond.\n\nSet in the late 2000s, Bahnstrecke Bremen - Oldenburg is represented before the line became part of the Bremen S-Bahn, recreating services and rolling stock lost to the passage of time. Look out for the towering “Rollklappbrücke” in Oldenburg, a Bascule Bridge which crosses the Hunte river, raising and lowering to allow trains and barges to pass.\n\nRide and Drive passenger and freight trains across the scenic plains of Northern Germany, complete route tasks, or simply go trainspotting from your favourite vantage point. Customise your own experiences with the Scenario Planner and Livery Designer and share them on Creators Club.\n\n# Key Features \n\n- 44 km route from Bremen Hbf to Oldenburg Hbf set in the late 2000s\n- DB BR 110.3 electric locomotive and Karlsruher Kopf n-Wagens in DB Red livery\n- PRESS BR 155 electric locomotive in PRESS Blue livery\n- Tadgs, Habbins and Laaers freight wagons\n- DB BR 425 EMU in DB Red livery\n- AI-Only Barge for Hunte river traffic (Livery Designer compatible)\n- Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cabs\n- True-to-life performance and handling\n- Accessible Tutorials on the Training Center\n- Includes 6 Scenarios and an extensive 24-Hour Timetable\n- Journey Mode tying together Training, Scenarios and Timetabled Services\n- A selection of Route Tasks to complete\n- Livery Designer and Scenario Planner compatible.
