You play as the son of Earth’s ambassador, a young hero whose life has been shaped by the haunting beauty and deep sorrows of the planet Ora. Your first visit to this alien world remains vivid in your memory: the shimmering blue of the mineral Zendle, a substance so striking it seemed to leap from the planet’s surface into your ship, casting everything in its melancholic glow. This mineral defines Ora’s landscape and mirrors the plight of its inhabitants, the Depth Dwellers—a once-proud people driven underground by centuries of brutal conflict with the neighboring planet, Riase. Adapted to their subterranean existence, the Depth Dwellers bear the physical scars of their exile: oversized, luminous eyes that gleam with the quiet despair of a life spent beneath the surface, far from the sunlit skies they once knew.\n\nYour father, a renowned diplomat famed for turning even the most ruthless enemies into allies, was dispatched by Earth to negotiate peace between the Depth Dwellers and the relentless Ri. The Council of the Depth Dwellers sought his expertise to end the war that had ravaged their world. But the Ri are a force of destruction, their home planet Riase a testament to their greed. Once a verdant paradise of sprawling gardens and fertile valleys, Riase now lies desolate—its resources plundered without thought for the future, its surface a cracked, windswept graveyard of dust and ruin. Driven by desperation and ambition, the Ri have set their sights on Ora, determined to seize its Zendle at any cost, even if it means exterminating every last Depth Dweller.\n\nThe Ri’s hunger for Zendle stems from its newly discovered potential: a key component in a revolutionary weapons system that could cement their dominance over not just Ora, but all nine planets in their solar system. To fuel this war machine, they’ve enslaved the Depth Dwellers, forcing them to toil in the dark tunnels, mining the very resource that could spell their doom. Amid this escalating crisis, your time on Ora is marked by your deep connection with Princess Aurora, the fiery and resolute daughter of the Depth Dwellers’ leadership. What began as childhood games during diplomatic events blossomed into a partnership forged in shared ideals and rigorous training. Together, you spent countless hours mastering an array of weapons—from energy blades to projectile launchers—and honing combat techniques, as Aurora fiercely advocated for her people to resist the Ri\n\nThe turning point comes on your final night together. In a moment of raw vulnerability, Aurora confides in you: she and a group of rebels have intercepted messages between the Ri’s mining operations and their leaders on RiDetailed text hereRiase. The transmissions reveal a chilling escalation—the Ri no longer seek merely to subjugate Ora; they aim to conquer the entire solar system, wielding Zendle as their ultimate weapon. As her tear-filled eyes reflect the anguish of her people and the horrors awaiting countless others, you hold her close, the weight of the impending struggle settling over you both. Aurora and her allies are ready to act, and the fight for survival begins.\n",
