  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# DISCOVER THE TRUTH\n<!--text-->\nAs the leader of a special task force, you are sent to investigate strange and mysterious events at the Mars Terraforming Center after contact with it was suddenly lost, and the first team sent to investigate has vanished without a trace.\n\nStep into the dark and chaotic atmosphere of the research center, where madness and disaster reign. Explore the abandoned offices and gather vital clues from your team: photos, reports, classified documents, voice recordings, and personal diaries. Piece together the horrifying events that started with a groundbreaking scientific discovery… and uncover what Mars has hidden for thousands of years.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# MAKE DECISIONS\n<!--text-->\nAs the head of the investigation, you’ll have to make hard decisions and give orders to your team. But how much can you trust in their loyalty? Some may have secrets, hidden agendas, or motives of their own. And are your higher-ups really as trustworthy as they seem? You’ll need to not only unravel the mysteries of the Terraforming Center, but also manage internal conflicts within your team, all while an unknown force from the depths of Mars hunts down anyone brave enough to stand in its way.\n\nEvery decision you make leaves a lasting mark, directly affecting the mission’s outcome. Can you keep your team alive in the battle for humanity’s future? Will you remain the mission leader as the truth becomes darker and honesty no longer comes cheap? Can you save the Mars colonies — and with them, all of humanity? Your team awaits your command. Are you ready to take on the challenge?\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# FEATURES\n<!--text-->\n- **Interactive Storyline:** Every choice you make shapes the events and the ultimate outcome of the mission.
