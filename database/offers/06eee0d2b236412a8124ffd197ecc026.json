  "longDescription": "Songs of Conquest's first new faction has arrived from the shores of the Bleak East. Conquer the lands of Aerbor as the mighty raiders of Vanir and witness their powerful transformation into the Vildra. Carve a path through the snow in five new challenging Conquest maps as you command new powerful Wielders such as the shapeshifted Gorm the Endbringer or Jarn Steadfast, the one who refused to Change.\n\n# Included in the Vanir faction DLC:\n\n- A new biome with snow, ice, and ruins to explore\n- 8 troops with new traits and abilities\n- Upgrading Vanir troops often change the troop completely, mechanically and visually\n- 9 Wielders with both new and old specializations\n- Town and settlements with new buildings\n- Access to Essence of Destruction, Arcana and Chaos\n- New styles of play with more easily accessed dyads\n- 5 new Conquest maps highlighting the Vanir Biome and faction\n- 2 new Challenge maps to test your skills and knowledge of this new faction\n- Artifact sets focused on Vanir gameplay, which also opens up tactics for other factions\n\nOwning the DLC does not exclude you from playing against others online, even if they don’t own the DLC, or vice versa.\n\n# The Vanir\n\nThe Vanir are a hardy folk descended from the indebted of Barya and ragtag settlers from Arleon. Over the years they’ve grown into a folk who now raid their former masters. But the Bleak East is not a peaceful place and a terror known as the Roots has forced them to embrace the temperamental creatures of the land, the Vildra.\nThe power of the Vildra can change a human into a fearsome beast, ready to do battle against any foe. Many a Wielder has taken this path to rage and power.\n\n- With the Vildra’s power unleashing, a Huskarl can be transformed into a Korphan, switching the spear for beaks and talons while leaping into the enemy's backlines.\n- The Berserkir can truly unleash their rage as they change into a mighty Bear, challenging any who dare oppose their weaker brethren.\n- The Chieftain is used to commanding his forces but once the Pride of the Vildra takes root within, they grow to enormous proportions, turning into a Jormr of myth and legend.\n- The Vanir’s kind Swine was turned into an ever-living version of itself. The Serimnaan can be eaten in the evening and in the morning be found happily rolling around in the mud.\n - But the Vildra bring their own to the battle as well. Troll, Lykt, Bacahorse, and Nornor are all more than willing to rip apart any who stand against them.\nSo how will you command the Vanir? Will they stay human or embrace their wilder side and truly become the beasts that lurk inside all of us?\n\n# A Bleak Biome\n\nWith the Vanir also comes a new Biome of snow, ice, and forests for as far as the eye can see. The Bleak East is just as harsh as the name implies. With new places to visit, new caverns to plunder, and riches to be had. How will you conquer them?\n\n# Advanced Artifact Sets\n\nIncluded in the Vanir DLC are many new artifact sets, both of lower power and with the power to awe even the mightiest of Wielders. An artifact set grows in power as each piece of the set is acquired. These new sets will now be found in all maps in the game, both new and old.\n\n# Many more maps\n\nTwo small, two medium and one large Conquest maps are included in the Vanir DLC, specially designed for playing with Vanir. Will you defend your home against the invading houses of Barya, plunder the shores of the weakened Arleon, or trudge into the Marshes of the Rana?\nIn addition to the conquest maps, there will be two Challenge maps to test your skills with this new faction. Take charge of Sorg, a lost Troll who’s just trying to find his way home or stand against the corruption of the Vildra as Jarn Steadfast, the one who refused to Change.\n\n\n\n",
