When you design the presets and import them into the blueprint instance, you can quickly generate the stair BP. Be able to modify the shape, size, material of the various components of the staircase, and finally become the staircase you need.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why use the Quick Spline Stairs System?</p><p><br /></p><p>Stairs are needed in most projects, and the traditional stair making process needs to be completed in 3D software and then imported, or static grid art materials are used. But these don&#39;t necessarily match the needs of your project and waste time in the revision process. Quick Spline Stairs System is built modularized and programmed. After the template is made, you can easily adjust the parameters through splines and blueprints. In the project, you can modify and adjust in real time to match your project requirements.</p><p><br /></p><p>Components included in the Quick Spline Stairs System:</p><p><br /></p><p>The path is composed of platform and channel. The platform is generated at the spline point, and the platform shape is adjusted according to the spline Angle. The vertices are completely aligned, and the platforms are connected by channels.</p><p><br /></p><p>Steps: Steps are generated on a passage that exceeds the step height and are classified as traditional steps, suspended steps (e.g. industrial stairs), and steps with a top step (e.g. domestic wooden stairs).</p><p><br /></p><p>Railings: The railings are generated on both sides of the trail and can be adjusted into square or round pillars, or replaced with custom mesh.</p><p><br /></p><p>Handrails: Handrails are seamless meshwork created along both sides of the walk, which can be used as traditional stair handrails, or can be offset to both sides of the step as slope decoration.</p><p><br /></p><p>Decoration: Decoration is a decorative balustrade that is generated between two main balustrades. Multiple balustrades can be generated and adjusted to various angles, resulting in a variety of different styles and styles of stairs.</p><p><br /></p><p>Other: There are piers, ceilings and other components that can generate and adjust styles.</p><p><br /></p><p>Non-destructive workflow: The Stairs generated by the Quick Spline Stairs System can be used directly in your project, even during the initial phase of the project and the testing phase, and can be used as a basis for your project. Changes can be made very quickly just by dragging splines to adjust blueprints to expose variables only, and can be saved as data assets to reuse styles. Compared to traditional workflows made from other 3D software, it provides great convenience, saves a lot of time, and keeps your project under control.</p><p><br /></p><p>Operation process</p><p>1. Create a style on the Quick Spline Stairs System instance BP and store the style to the data asset.</p><p>2. Import and drag the splines in the Quick Spline Stairs System instance BP in the map to make the stairs to match your project needs.</p><p>3, the data asset configuration to the Quick Spline Stairs System instance BP that is easy and simple to complete your stairs.</p><p>BUG submission, function application - QQ group: 921204210 (need to provide purchase credentials)</p>",
