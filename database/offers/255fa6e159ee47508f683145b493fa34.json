  "description": "ByteBox is a modular inventory system plugin for Unreal Engine, enabling multiplayer-ready inventories for players, AI, and world objects like chests and workbenches. It's designed for easy customization and future upgrades.",
  "longDescription": "<p>ByteBox is a highly versatile and modular inventory system plugin designed for Unreal Engine, offering an intuitive and robust solution for inventory management in multiplayer or single-player games. It is specifically built with scalability in mind, making it perfect for a wide range of use cases, from players&#39; inventory systems to non-player entities (such as AI characters or chests) and in-game interactable objects like workbenches. This plugin is ideal for developers looking for a powerful and flexible solution that can be integrated seamlessly into different game genres, whether action RPGs, survival games, or simulation-based experiences. ByteBox is also designed with future-proofing in mind, allowing for easy updates and feature expansions.</p><p><br /></p><h2><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><ul><li>Multiplayer-Ready Inventory Management: ByteBox is built to work flawlessly in multiplayer environments, ensuring inventory synchronization across all clients and servers. It handles both dedicated server and peer-to-peer networking setups, making it adaptable to various multiplayer systems.</li></ul><p>  </p><ul><li>Universal Inventory System: ByteBox allows you to add inventory functionality to any type of actor, including players, AI characters, in-game objects like chests, workbenches, and more. The system supports interactions between these actors for seamless item transfers.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Inventory Component &amp; Backend Integration: At the core of ByteBox is a highly flexible inventory component that can be added to any actor. Each actor’s inventory can be tracked and managed independently while still offering the ability to transfer items between them. Additionally, the system integrates smoothly with backend databases (like MongoDB) to save and load user inventory data across game sessions.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Item Transfer Functionality: Easily transfer items between inventories. Whether you need to move items from a player&#39;s inventory to a chest or from a workbench back to the player, ByteBox&#39;s transfer system handles the process with minimal setup required. This functionality is multiplayer-ready and works seamlessly across different game states.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Item Struct System: The inventory system is powered by a flexible item struct system, allowing you to define various item types like consumables, equipment, materials, and quest items. This struct is easily extendable, ensuring that developers can add custom item attributes such as special conditions, ammo types, or future upgrades like special bonuses or statuses.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Attributes and Metadata: Each item in ByteBox can carry attributes such as stack size, weight, description, or custom metadata, allowing players to have detailed interactions with each item. From using consumables to equipping gear, everything can be handled easily within the system.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Gameplay Tags Support: ByteBox utilizes Unreal Engine&#39;s Gameplay Tags system to categorize and filter items efficiently. This allows developers to use tags for special conditions, buffs, debuffs, or other item behaviors, making the system both powerful and easy to use.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Player and AI Integration: The plugin is designed with both player and AI characters in mind. Inventory systems can be integrated seamlessly into AI, making it possible for enemies or NPCs to hold items that players can loot. ByteBox also supports custom behaviors, such as AI-controlled characters using items.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Easy-to-Use API: ByteBox comes with a well-documented API, making it simple to extend or customize for your game&#39;s unique requirements. The inventory system is completely blueprint-friendly, offering full functionality in both C&#43;&#43; and Blueprints.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Customizable UI Integration: Developers can integrate ByteBox with custom UI widgets to create fully dynamic inventory menus. It supports drag-and-drop functionality, item details pop-ups, and any other custom UI logic that you would need to implement for an inventory screen.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Plugin and Module System: ByteBox is implemented as a reusable plugin, meaning it can be easily shared between different projects or sold on the Unreal Marketplace. By using a modular system, developers can use ByteBox as a standalone inventory system in future projects without additional coding.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Inventory Weight System: If your game features weight-based inventory limitations, ByteBox can handle that for you, calculating the total weight of items in the inventory and preventing over-encumbrance when necessary.</li></ul><h2><strong> Customization Options:</strong></h2><p>ByteBox is designed to be customizable to suit your project needs:</p><ul><li>Extendable Item Structs: You can easily extend item structs with new attributes. For example, if your game requires special ammo types, crafting materials, or other complex items, the ByteBox struct system is flexible enough to accommodate them.</li><li>Custom Backends: While ByteBox works out of the box with standard Unreal Engine systems, it can also be integrated with custom backend databases to track persistent inventory data across multiple sessions, making it perfect for online and persistent-world games.</li><li>Blueprint and C&#43;&#43; Compatibility: All features of ByteBox are accessible in both Blueprint and C&#43;&#43;. This ensures that even developers working in Blueprints can leverage the full power of ByteBox’s inventory system.</li></ul><p><br /></p><h2><strong> Use Cases:</strong></h2><p>ByteBox can be used in a wide variety of game types and scenarios:</p><ul><li>Survival Games: Players need to manage limited inventories, craft items, and store materials in chests or other containers. ByteBox handles item stacking, weight, and equipment easily.</li><li>RPGs: From potions to weapons, ByteBox lets players carry a variety of items, with support for quest items, gear, and consumables. Inventory systems can be bound to player stats and abilities.</li><li>Loot-Based Games: Players can loot enemies and NPCs using ByteBox’s built-in item transfer functionality, ensuring a seamless experience for acquiring and using items found in the world.</li><li>Crafting Systems: Workbenches and other crafting stations can store materials and products made from those materials. Items can be easily transferred between player inventories and workbench inventories.</li><li>Online and Persistent World Games: With backend integration, ByteBox can persist player inventories between sessions and across different servers.</li></ul><h2><br /></h2><h2><strong> Why Choose ByteBox?</strong></h2><p>ByteBox is designed to be future-proof and flexible, making it easy for developers to integrate and expand upon.
