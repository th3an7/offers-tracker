However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.\n- 3 epic boss fights — Combat the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death  and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...\n- 20 Castlevania outfits — roleplay as all your favourite characters like Alucard, Richter Belmont , Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself!\n",
