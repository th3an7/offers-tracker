  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# GEO-POLITICAL SIMULATOR 5: THE ULTIMATE SIMULATION OF TODAY'S WORLD\n<!--text-->\n**GPS5: THE ULTIMATE SIMULATION OF TODAY'S WORLD**\n\nGeopolitical Simulator 5 - aka GPS5 - is a simulation of our current world, recreating its features in-depth and across a number of domains: economic, political, military, social, financial, environmental, energetic, transportation…\nEvery country and major multinational corporation are represented with their own variables and functions. The calculation and scenario engines include more than 150,000 facts and figures, 20,000 texts, and 12 hours of recorded dialog. An ultra-detailed and animated 3D map with vegetation, bodies of water, every border, regions, production facilities, and important strategic sites around the world become your playground.\nThe game combines management stages of economics, commerce, wargames, construction, espionage, simulation, and political influence and manipulation.\nYou can opt to control one or more countries or one or more major corporations simultaneously and devise collaborative strategies to change your own destiny or the world's. Game sessions are customizable in several ways: activity level of terrorist organizations, probability of natural disasters, reactions of the people, outbreak of wars... More than twenty contextual scenarios with current events from today's world are integrated.\nThe game engine, Geopolitical Simulator 5, includes over 600 data elements for each of the 175 playable countries and calculates their changes in real time throughout the game based on players’ actions. Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. More than 3000 major worldwide companies are included along with their real world data and several thousand others are simulated for all economic sectors and all the countries of the world. The simulator technology of GPS 5 is used by various organizations for instruction or training purposes, including NATO.\n\n**WHAT'S NEW IN GPS5**\n\n*New Map*\n\nThe new 3D world map is 10 times more precise than GPS4, with almost 2 million polygons and more than 10 million grid squares for you to build on along with the ability to zoom in closer to the ground. There are new high-resolution textures (forests, rocks, farmland...) along with the modeling of rivers, lakes, bridges, tunnels, and more than 60 types of buildings (commercial, factories, infrastructures...)\nThe military unit movement AI is optimized according to the type of terrain and highways.\n\n*New Macro-Economic Engine*\n\nIt has been restructured to include the simulation of thousands of worldwide companies that contribute to the GDP of the country, with finer detail on economic exchanges between countries, product shortages and surplus situations, price variation, taxes, embargoes, etc. The engine includes all the buildings present on the world map and in all activity sectors (in GPS4, only the energy sector was included). New sectors have been added: fertilizer, hydrogen, food industry, medical equipment, mobile phones, etc.\n\n*New Interface*\n\nThe interface has been completely redesigned and revamped to be more dynamic and user-friendly.\nIt is designed to adapt to different-sized screens and to make use of their respective configurations, especially for 4K screens or double screens. The player can also choose the scale of the interface for optimal viewing and to pre-position game windows to organize and personalize their space. A generalized information system allows the player to access detailed explanations or additional information on game elements.\n\n*Scenarios 2024*\n\nSeveral contextual scenarios illustrate current events: American presidential election, terrorist threats to the Olympic Games, new French political situation, war in Ukraine.\n\n**PLAY AS THE HEAD OF STATE**\n\nOver one thousand playable actions. At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.\nPropose bills to be voted on in Parliament, for example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.\nThe player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.\n\n**PLAY AS THE OPPOSITION**\n\nAt the head of a legal or illegal organization, the player can take power by force, revolution, diplomacy, or democratic election. To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates…\n\n**PLAY AS THE CEO OF A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION**\n\nAs the head of one or more of these companies, you have all the tools and all the information necessary to lead and develop your companies.\nEach company's data is precisely detailed: revenue, market shares, sales by product, competition, shareholders, staffing, balance sheet...\nYou must engage in multiple activities within the company: production, commerce, marketing, human resources, finances, taxation, research, security, legal, and politics.\nYou'll have advisors in various domains and you can also speak to your banker, shareholder representative, or union leader.\nReaching these goals - for example, becoming one of the largest multinational companies in the world or joining the ranks of the billionaire class - will also require resolving conflicts with the union AI, demonstrating sound strategy concerning the competition by making financial decisions (takeover bids, creation of subsidiaries, initial public offerings…), even crossing over to the dark side (along with the risks involved) by engaging in malfeasance of all kinds (paying out kickbacks, tax evasion, tax fraud, illegal price fixing, political lobbying).\n\n**LOBBYIST AND CHARACTER AI**\n\nAll actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...).\nTo prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 12 hours of dialogue in the game).\n\n**REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES**\n\nThe world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups...\nAs a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts. City battles are shown on precise maps with all the major buildings and intersections. The players, according to the side they represent, can direct police, hooligans, military personnel or armed extremists to these locations and construct barricades, send in snipers, loot the banks, or have armoured vehicles move in.\n\n**SECRET SERVICES**\n\nSecret services play an important role. They have an arsenal of espionage and special operations: reveal scandals about an opposing political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage foreign infrastructure, assassinate an opponent, send reconnaissance drones or position satellites to locate enemy units, etc.\n\n**INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS**\n\nInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.\n\n**SIMULATION OF MAJOR GLOBAL THREATS**\n\nGeopolitical Simulator 5 simulates all the major perils that threaten the planet and produces a comprehensive assessment for each one from the results along with specific graphics. The list of threats is substantial and many of them are interconnected: global warming, the widening of social inequality, the risk of global atomic war, overpopulation, unemployment, atmospheric pollution, terrorism, cybercrime, regional conflicts, food insecurity, world hunger, deforestation, natural disasters (storms, floods, drought, extreme heat...), rising sea levels, ocean acidity, disappearance of animal species, climate refugees, epidemics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals…\n\n**MULTIPLE OPTIONS**\n\n-Single-player game in multi-country mode allows the player to play multiple countries and/or companies simultaneously\n-Game settings: terrorist activities, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of the populations, outbreak of war\n-Player ranking online and in real time\n-Incorporation of your own photos, logos, names to make the game even more realistic\n-Interactive tutorial and game help available at all times during the game\n-Configuration options with double screen or 4K screen, choice of interface size for optimal viewing, and the option to personalize and reorganize your space.\n-Text and dialog 100% in English\n",
