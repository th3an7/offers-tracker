  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# About the DLC:\n<!--text-->\nTwo savants from largely disparate backgrounds: one born a slave, the other into Imperial nobility. Fate saw their paths inextricably intertwined, and neither escaped unscarred. Both of their journeys are long – roads filled with trials and tribulations – but while the aristocrat has taken a path that may shake their belief in the very Gods they so passionately worship, the former slave’s quest is a discovery of the past; an inward journey, possibly taking players to the ends of their wits.\n\nVagrus – The Riven Realms: Old Acquaintances, introduces two new Companions with new abilities, individual and specific loyalty quests that explore their own stories, new enemies and rewards, as well as newfound additions to hirelings that can join owners of the DLC.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Content and Features\n<!--text-->\n- Two fully fleshed-out Companions with unique backstories, motivations, and goals in the Riven Realms\n- Extensive loyalty questlines for each Companion, covering narratives that will see you explore never-before-seen locations and delve into Realm-shattering secrets\n- A variety of new enemies that fit into each Companion’s story, showcasing one of the Realms’ most terrifying factions, and bringing to the fore entities of ancient realms, equipped with forbidden knowledge and long-lost power\n- New hirelings that function separately from each Companion, yet provide powerful boosts to any /comitatus/ compatible with their demanding overlords\n- A cast of new NPCs from two very distinct worlds and backgrounds\n- The new Companions are also powerful new Deputies capable of impacting your comitatus in various ways narratively as well as in combat\n\n\n*Note:* This store page will be updated with more information as we are nearing release and reveal more details on the two Companions and other content.\n",
