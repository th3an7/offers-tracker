  "longDescription": "<h2>Due to engine changes in 4.20&#43;, this plugin unfortunately won&#39;t work. I will still provide support for all users &lt;4.20</h2><p><br /></p><p><strong>Demo Video: </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2oV3FSf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here!</a></p><p><strong>Demo Standalone Build: </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2HPO4fr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here!</a></p><p><strong>Support Discord Server: </strong><a href=\"http://ars-discord.jverbeek.de\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here!</a></p><p>The <strong>Advanced Replay System</strong> is full-packed with features which make it super easy to integrate a fully working replay system in your game with less work. It only requires four Blueprint nodes to create a fully working replay system which can record and playback replays.</p><p>One special feature is the ability to store custom metadata with replays. With an easy Blueprint wildcard system, you can store every struct you want, containing data such as weather conditions, or game difficulty with your replay, which can be displayed in an user interface later.</p><p>Another special feature is the event system. With that, you are enabled to store data on the replay&#39;s timeline while recording. The player killed someone, or opened a loot crate? No problem, you can easily store that as an event and when playing back the replays, you can get those events and display them on the timeline, with custom data stored with the events!</p><p>The plugin also implements a new &#34;recorder&#34;, which records the replay to memory while playing, and saves it to disk when you stop the recording. No performance decrease while recording can be noticed!</p>",
