  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Slog through space in SpaceSlog\n<!--text-->\nSlog through space in SpaceSlog. A difficult sci-fi spaceship sim with an emphasis on ship building, crew interaction and exploration. Inspired by games such as Rimworld, Starship Theory, Dwarf Fortress and X-COM and other media such as Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate Universe and The Expanse. \n\nYour capital ship has been attacked by an unknown entity. Fortunately several survivors have managed to escape in a small ship. Now alone, hungry and lost in space, you must explore the cosmos and guide them to safety.\n\n\n**Current Features**\n\n- Build your ship any way you choose. \n- A newly generated galaxy to explore every time you play. \n- Meet other factions, friend or foe. \n- Manage your crews moods and needs. \n- Trade with passing ships and factions. \n- Electrical power simulation. Build cables, generators and batteries. \n- Atmospheric simulation. Place down gas generators, gas scrubbers, air tanks, ducting and air vents to carry gas around your ship. \n- Develop your own story every time you play. \n- Extensive Mod support. \n- Plus moreâ€¦\n\n\n\n**Build your ship any way you please.**\n\nWhether you want to build a small but nimble ship with a small crew, or a large battleship with lots of crew, the choice is yours. Just ensure you have enough supplies to manage your crew and keep your ship functioning. \n\nCareful consideration must be used when placing doors and your power systems in case of breaches or other hazards.\n\n\n**Explore a procedurally generated galaxy. **\n\nEach time you play, the game's events system will generate a different galaxy for you to explore. Whichever difficulty you choose will influence how this galaxy or events are generated.\n\n\n**Exploration is key to survival.**\n\nStay in one place for too long or get stranded and your crew will surely die. You must keep moving and find other ships or factions to trade with in order to survive.\n\n\n**Crew needs and moods.**\n\nThe needs of your crew must be met in order to keep your ship fully functioning. An angry crew may rebel, decide not to work or give up completely. Ensure you have enough food and water to feed your crew. You must also choose your captain wisely.\n\n\n**Complex combat and medical simulations.**\n\nFight other spaceships with ship to ship combat. Gear up and board your enemies or descend to a planet and attack them on the ground. Ensure you have a medic bay and spare limbs to patch up your fallen heroes.\n\n\n**Extensive mod support.**\n\nAll the game's data is stored in JSON files. This means it is extremely easy to change anything currently in the game and even add new ones. In the future we plan to expand on this even further.\n\n\n**Mod development pedigree.**\n\nThe author of SpaceSlog has spent 10 years painstakingly developing a large and popular free modification for Mount&Blade Warband called A World of Ice and Fire. This is the reason for wanting extensive mod support and should hopefully give peace of mind for anyone wanting to purchase SpaceSlog, knowing the author is dedicated and willing to finish a project.\n",
