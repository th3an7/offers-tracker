  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Foxyball: A boutique leisure game, perfect for solo gaming, bonding with kids, sharing moments with your spouse, friends and family.\n<!--text-->\n*Note:\nWe realized that the atmosphere in the gameplay are somewhat underwhelming, we are committed to improving the player experience and will continue to release **free major updates** to address these shortcomings. We kindly ask for your patience as this is part of a long-term vision.\nThank you for your trust and support!*\n\nFOXYBALL is a fun and easy-to-play game inspired by Football Penalty. Instead of playing against a goalkeeper, the goal is divided into 24 blocks, with a new random configuration for players each attempt. To score, players will need a combination of luck, skill, and smart decision-making.\n\nWe created FOXYBALL to be a simple, relaxing experience—quick to learn, easy to play, and perfect for unwinding. It recaptures the charm and joy of the games we grew up with back in the 1990s and early 2000s, where players could jump right in and start having fun.. \n\nFOXYBALL is about instant fun and relaxation. The game offers 4 distinct play modes within:\n\n- “Starlink” and “Starlight” are ideal for solo play, offering the perfect way to relax while challenging yourself to higher score.\n\n- “Teamgeist” mode encourages teamwork, as you and your friends or family join forces to solve tricky challenges together.\n\n- “Jackpot” mode offers a competitive and friendly battle where lets players face off in a tactical showdown.\n\nFOXYBALL is an entertainment that fits any occasion—from solo play to family day or social events. \n\nWe recommend the “Starlink” and “Starlight” modes for those looking to unwind or enjoy some solo time such as during a cozy weekend afternoon. If you have a STEAM DECK, this game would be a perfect companion for your daily commute or longer journeys.\n\nFor a more social experience, please do try the 'Teamgeist' and 'Jackpot' modes. They’re perfect for introducing your children to the joys of both football and gaming, bringing fun and laughter to family time, or sharing sweet, playful moments with your mates or loved one.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Foxyball-1wym3](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/1302df3ff28e4d0eb8809ed831047476/foxyball-1wym3.png)\n",
