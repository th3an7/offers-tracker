  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe Roots, an ancient sentient colony of flora, fungus, and the bones of lost heroes have spread from deep within the Wyldwoods of the Bleak East. The Roots relentlessly expand the Wyldwoods to secure their survival against any threats.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Included in the Roots faction DLC:\n<!--text-->\n- A new biome, the sentient forest of the Bleak East.\n- 8 troops with new traits and abilities\n- 9 Wielders with both new and old specializations\n- Their own unique way of handling Essence\n- Town and settlements with new buildings\n- 5 new Conquest maps highlighting the new biome and faction\n- 2 new challenge maps to showcase the lore and test your skills\n- New Artifact sets\n\nOwning the DLC does not exclude you from playing against others online, even if they don’t own the DLC, or vice versa.\"\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# The Roots\n<!--text-->\nWhen the settlers of the Bleak East arrived, they soon found a vast, magical forest which they named the Wyldwoods. Within it lived a massive sentient colony called the Roots. All of the Wyldwoods are the Roots, and to tread within is to brave grave danger. To die within means to serve the Roots forever.\n\nAny worthy sentient beings that die within the Wyldwoods are regrown to be of use to the Roots in their ongoing search for more Vessels. A Vessel is a dead being brought back with the powers of a Wielder. This is a very rare occurrence, and most dead are brought back as broken versions of the Vessels. So they are simply called Broken Vessels. Hordes and hordes of these things roam the woods of the Wyldwoods, and now they are yours to command.\n\nThe Roots are the source of all life and all magic, so it is only natural that they have access to all five of the essences, but if they do not work in symbiosis with each other, their access to essence is weak.\n\nMost Roots troops only have one essence, but they all have a trait called symbiosis. Once a troop stands next to another, its essence spreads to its neighbour.\n\nHow will you control the flow of essence? Will you create hordes of broken vessels and use their symbiosis to unleash the essence of Arcana, or will you instead create a stampede of dreads that support each other with order on the frontline? The choice is yours.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Wyldwoods Biome\n<!--text-->\nWith the Roots also comes a new Biome of lush, green forests filled with flora, fungi and new magical places to visit. The Wyldwoods is as dangerous as it is beautiful.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Maps\n<!--text-->\nTwo small, two medium, and one large Conquest maps are included in the Roots DLC, specially designed for playing with the Roots. Will you spread your Roots in Patrium, defeat the Faey of the Tenderwyld, or seek the powerful lost seed of the Roots?\n\nIn addition to the conquest maps, there will be two challenge maps focusing on the story and lore of the Roots. Play as Gro Aelgrim, embraced by the Roots to become the new Vessel Grow, or protect a freshly sprouted Tree Mother that has taken root in the woods of Arleon.\n",
