  "longDescription": "Peel back the veil to uncover the secret to richer Sim lives and beyond in The Sims™ 4 Life & Death Expansion Pack*. Achieve your dreams in life by ticking items off your Bucket List or pursue them as a Ghost with Unfinished Business. There is a ghastly new world to haunt, a career that’ll bring you closer to Grim, Wills to write, Crypts to explore, and even ghostly skills to master. There are no real endings – only transitions – as you move between life, afterlife, and even rebirth.\n\n# An Endless Journey\nBuild your Bucket List by collecting goals throughout your Sim’s life, starting as a Young Adult. Items will appear on your list based on your Sim’s traits and family relations, and you can also choose your own. If a Sim’s life ends with items still on their list, they can devote their afterlife to completing their Unfinished Business. The ultimate reward for experiencing everything on their list is the option to be Reborn, though you can still choose to Move On or remain on this plane as a Ghost.\n\n# A Ghastly, Gorgeous Life\nMake death your life’s work with a career of reaping souls, helping Ghosts, dispersing hauntings, and more as a member of Grim’s team. Outside of work, you might spend your days exploring Crypts and building your Thanatology skill for the new Ghost Historian Aspiration. These things – among other dark diversions like bonding with your Pet Crow or collecting and reading the lost Tarot Cards of Lady Ravendancer Goth – will have a special appeal to Sims who are Macabre, one of 3 new traits.\n\n# Goodbye (For Now)\nDifferent Sims will grieve in different ways. There are 4 types that will tie in with both Sims’ personalities and their relationships with the deceased. Grieving Rituals are customizable and unscripted, allowing you to hold whatever type of event fits your story. In life, Sims can create Wills which can be used to pass down Heirlooms, distribute their Simoleons, and more. Sims can honor the departed with a memorial display featuring their portrait, and by interring their urns in Crypts or with Custom Caskets and Gravesites.\n\n# Friendly or Fiendish?\nLinger on as a Ghost and spend your afterlife helping or terrorizing the living. Ghosts will grow in their abilities as they do everything from assisting with household chores to levitating living Sims and hanging them upside down (fun AND profitable - they may drop Simoleons!). Their interactions with the living can earn them Fear or Goodwill essences, which can both be sold for Simoleons. There’s a lot to do after death; Ghosts can even pair up for a special, spectral Woohoo.\n\n# A Town Worth Haunting\nThe veil between life and death is thin in Ravenwood, a three-neighborhood town. The residents of these first two neighborhoods are (mostly) alive, but it’s Ghosts who will feel most at home in the third. Living Sims can use its Baleful Bog to have an out of body experience and try their hands at being temporary Ghosts. Just don’t overdo it.\n\n*Requires The Sims 4 & all game updates. See minimum system requirements for the pack.",
