  "description": "Animation Split and Animation Blend in Editor.",
  "longDescription": "<ol><li>This plugin offers powerful functionality for skeletal animations in <strong>Metahuman, Unreal Engine 4, and Unreal Engine 5</strong>. It can assist you in splitting existing animations and blending them to create new animations, while also supporting the generation of seamless looping animations.</li><li>With the <strong>splitting </strong>feature, you can easily break down source animations into individual parts within the plugin. These parts include seven segments such as the Lower Body, with the Lower Body segment also encompassing the pelvis information. This splitting capability allows precise control over each segment&#39;s animation, enabling further editing and refinement.</li><li>Additionally, the plugin provides a <strong>blending</strong> function, allowing you to mix animations from different segments to create entirely new animation effects. By dragging the desired animations into the plugin and using the Blend button, you can synthesize animations that retain the distinct motion characteristics of each segment. These blended animations can be further adjusted and optimized to meet your specific requirements.</li><li>In addition to the splitting and blending features, the plugin<strong> supports the generation of animations with seamless loops</strong>. This means you can create animations that smoothly repeat at the beginning and end, providing improved transitioning effects and continuity.</li></ol><p><br /></p><ul><li>When using this plugin, you can expect the following additional features and advantages:</li><li><strong>Customizable Frame Rate: </strong>The plugin supports customizing the frame rate of the final generated animation. You can choose the minimum frame rate, maximum frame rate, or specify a specific frame rate to meet your needs. This allows you to control the duration and smoothness of the animation based on your scene or requirements.</li><li><strong>Linear Interpolation:</strong> The plugin provides linear interpolation functionality, allowing you to achieve smooth transitions in animations. By specifying a frame count in the input box, you can perform linear interpolation starting from the last frame of the animation, resulting in smooth transitions when the animation is played. This is particularly useful for creating transitional animations or enhancing the overall smoothness of the animation.</li><li><strong>Frame Addition: </strong>The plugin also offers frame addition functionality, allowing you to add extra frames to a specified animation. This enables you to extend the duration of the animation or add more detail, resulting in a richer and more precise animation effect.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Overall, this plugin offers powerful tools and functionality for <strong>skeletal animations in Metahuman, Unreal Engine 4, and Unreal Engine 5 Standard Skeleton .</strong> Whether it&#39;s splitting, blending, or generating looping animations, it can help you create unique and impressive animation effects.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note&#xff1a;Blending Need the same framerate animations And Need the whole skeleton tree( can not use part of skeleton tree ).</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ksSYVi3xyiQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>v1.0.2 NEW FEATURE : Preview Animation</strong></p><p><strong>You can preview the Animation On diffenert part slot;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/DNUZxwqkm_E\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>v1.0.3 NEW FEATURE : Blending On Sequencer</strong></p><p><strong>You can blending Animations On Sequencer , more easy;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4CblOU60K7g\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>v1.0.4 NEW FEATURE : Batch Blending</strong></p><p><strong>You can blending Animations for Batch , more efficient&#xff1b;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jbjeYupzrO4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Preview : </p><p>v1.0.5 NEW FEATURE : Lock Foot Position, solve the foot sliding</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fSfwsEuIFaY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p>This video mainly demonstrates three newly added feature functions. </p><p>I believe these three functions are very useful in the process of blend animation, </p><p>and can solve the problems we encounter during blend animation, </p><p>such as the lack of pelvis rotation in the blending process, </p><p>and the foot sliding problem when the pelvis rotates; </p><p>So these three functions are mainly aimed at these problems, </p><p>optimizing the quality performance after blend animation; </p><p><strong>The first function:</strong> Use the rotation of the pelvis in the upper body animation, </p><p>because we previously defaulted to use the pelvis data in the lower body animation; </p><p><strong>The second function:</strong> You can specify a frame in the animation, lock the foot position of this frame, </p><p>and overwrite the foot position of the entire animation. </p><p>Its function is that when using the function of the pelvis rotation in the upper body animation, </p><p>the rotation of the pelvis will cause the problem of foot sliding. To avoid sliding, we can lock the foot position of a certain frame; </p><p><strong>The third function: </strong>You can keep the original position of the foot in the lower body animation, </p><p>and calculate the data of the leg bones according to IK, so as to avoid the foot sliding problem caused by the rotation of the pelvis; </p><p><strong>Important Noted that: </strong>The first function can be used in combination with the second function or the third function; </p><p>The second function and the third function are mutually exclusive, so do not check these two options at the same time.</p><p><br /></p>",
