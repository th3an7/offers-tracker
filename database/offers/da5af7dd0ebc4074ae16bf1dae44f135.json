Their massive spaceship collided with an uncharted celestial body, an enigmatic moon they would come to call Velaa.*\n\n*Stranded, with no way to continue their search for the new home they longed for, they will settle on Velaa. They have to forge a new existence, constructing a base from the moon's resources and mastering the art of producing their sustenance.*\n\n*In this alien world, hope rekindled, but the path ahead was a treacherous one, fraught with the unknown, and they were determined to meet it head-on.*\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Gameplay\n<!--text-->\nIn Moons of Ardan, you'll take charge of a resilient civilization of Axonauts, stranded on a remote moon in the vast expanse of space.
