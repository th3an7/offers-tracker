  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nA faithful priest of the Orthogonal order, exiled unto death for a crime in defense of another, you live again in a small boat, adrift in a swamp. A stranger ferries you to solid ground and bestows upon you vague instructions, along with a mysterious staff and book. Go forth, pious priest, alleviate suffering, uncover deceptions, and smash the eldritch perversions encroaching upon reality itself.\n\nA marriage between modern development tools and techniques with a stark late 90s aesthetic bring the action first person puzzler GRAVEN to life, featuring character designs by Chuck Jones (Duke Nukem 3d, Half-Life) and the voice talent of Stephan Weyte (Blood, Fire Emblem, Dusk) in a dark yet distinct medieval fantasy experience.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# DIGITAL ARTBOOK\n<!--text-->\n\nMuch more than just a collection of pretty pictures to look at, the official Artbook invites everyone to take a deep dive into the fascinating lore of the game’s world as well as to peek behind the curtain of the creative process of the development team. Fans of the game and art aficionados alike will enjoy the new layer added to their GRAVEN experience by the game’s official Digital Artbook, featuring 50+ pages of visual art produced during various stages of development, consisting of mostly never-before-shown concept art and other pieces, accompanied by commentary by the development team.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# SOUNDTRACK\n<!--text-->\n\nPut on your headphones and get instantly transported into the world of GRAVEN thanks to the 23 tracks from the game and 2 bonus tracks on top of that! The orchestral score, brilliantly composed by Nikola Nikita Jeremić, will instantly put you in the mood to explore the deadly bogs, decrepit villages and dilapidated catacombs and inspire the courage you will need to stay on the Parallel Path!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Full Tracklist:\n<!--text-->\n\n1 - Main Theme - 3:45\n2 - Alive? - 2:57\n3 - Upon the Docks - 3:26\n4 - The Brine Muskeg - 3:02\n5 - The Clotted Avenues - 3:05\n6 - Perusing the Tomes - 3:49\n7 - Phantoms in the Peat - 5:07\n8 - The Blackened House - 3:21\n9 - Salting the Earth - 3:26\n10 - Granite Watch - 3:16\n11 - The Snowblind Copse - 3:12\n12 - A Chattering Haze - 3:14\n13 - Grimwine's Mysteries - 3:16\n14 - Storming the Seat of Power - 3:14\n15 - Approaching the Effigial Throne - 3:16\n16 - Catafalque - 3:16\n17 - Greedily Deep - 3:02\n18 - Reverberations in the Ravine - 3:21\n19 - Illusion, Demystified - 3:07\n20 - Swallowed Granules - 3:12\n21 - The Lavish Profane - 3:12\n22 - A Creation's Remnant - 2:10\n23 - End Credits - 2:48\n24 - The Sepulchral Annex (Bonus Track) - 3:36\n25 - An Internal Siege (Bonus Track) - 3:07\n",
