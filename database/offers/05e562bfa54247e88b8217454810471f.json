  "longDescription": "Civilization VI is a historical strategy game with one goal: build an empire to stand the test of time. Explore new land, research technology, conquer your enemies, and go head-to-head with historical leaders as you lead your civilization from rocks to rockets. \n\nCreated by legendary game designer Sid Meier, Civilization is one of the most acclaimed and influential game franchises in strategy game history. In this most recent entry, you have more ways than ever to engage with your world. Choose a leader and pursue agendas inspired by their real-life counterparts. Physically cities expand across the map, create new strategic possibilities through the game as you pursue one of five ways to achieve victory.\n\nThis product upgrades the Civilization VI base game to Civilization VI Anthology - the complete collection of all Civ VI content released. Including  six DLC packs*, the expansions Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm, and the full New Frontier Pass.\n*Save vs buying DLC packs and expansions separately. If you already own any Civilization VI standalone content beyond the base game (like expansions or DLCs), do not buy this product or you will be double-charged for content.\n\n\nThe Sid Meier’s Civilization VI Anthology Upgrade includes: \n\nCIVILIZATION VI: RISE AND FALL: The Rise and Fall expansion brings new choices, strategies, and challenges for players as they guide a civilization through the ages. The expansion introduces new game mechanics including Great Ages and Governors, expands existing Diplomacy and Government systems, and adds 8 civilizations, 9 leaders, and many new units, districts, wonders, and buildings. Can you lead your people into a Golden Age of prosperity? Or will your empire face the challenges of a Dark Age? \n\nCIVILIZATION VI: GATHERING STORM: Explore an active planet in an expansion that introduces climate changes for the first time in series history. Contend with natural disasters and other new Environmental Effects, complete great Engineering Projects, and manage electrical power and consumable resources. Gathering Storm also introduces a World Congress and a new Diplomatic Victory condition. With an entire new era added to the Technology and Civics trees, as well as new civilizations, leaders, units, and buildings, Gathering Storm offers a tremendous amount of content for Civilization players. \n\nNEW FRONTIER PASS: Continue your quest to build the world’s greatest empire with the Civilization VI - New Frontier Pass, which introduces 6 new game modes for the first time in series history. Play with recruitable heroes from history and myth, dialed-up natural disasters in Apocalypse Mode, or secret societies that can enhance or undermine your empire. This content pack also features 8 new civilizations and 9 new leaders, as well as a heavy slate of new units, buildings, wonders, and more.\n\nand six additional leader and scenario DLC packs!",
