  "description": "A Multiplayer Experience in a Single-Player Game.\n\nThe Six Dragons is designed for players who enjoy MMORPG games but prefer a peaceful solo experience, while still offering multiplayer elements such as an MMO-like marketplace and economy, world bosses, and other unique features.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# A Multiplayer experience in a Single player game\n<!--text-->\n***Info***\n\nWelcome to The Six Dragons. \nDiscover 256km2 of Open-World full of surprises, extract from 1 billion dungeons, craft and enchant items.\n\n***The Game***\n\nTSD is a feature-rich, fantasy Open World RPG inspired by iconic RPG titles. The game features a huge 256km2-long world, full of loot, opportunities, fights, and excitement. The player can freely explore, farm, harvest, and craft 100s of unique items, constantly improve the arsenal by enchanting, and finally fight the most epic monster battles for the most precious loot.\n\nThe game has been in development for over five years and is going through significant upgrades to ensure an amazing experience. With that being said, all the users of the early versions should be aware that the game will be in development and not in its final version. Thus, constant updates and minor issues may exist and should be expected. Our current, tentative roadmap contains two game modes, “Open World” and “Story Mode” but additional game modes are being considered.\n\n***Key Gameplay Aspects***\n\n- Creating your path: Build your own class\nPlayers can build their own class, with a unique combination of abilities from three different class trees. The Wizard, the Warrior, and the Cleric.\nThose three categories of abilities were selected to include the necessary level of diversity in terms of gaming styles, allowing each player to build countless combinations of skills. The Wizard tree is focused on magical spells, Warrior tree on physical abilities, and the Cleric tree on healing abilities. At the moment, each tree will feature 33 abilities, and many more will be added.\n\n- Swords, Staffs, or Maces? Whatever fits your gameplay style\nSwords are favoring Warrior play-styles, Staffs will fit better to players with a focus on Wizard spells, and Maces are a more balanced option for hybrid player classes. At the moment there are 26 different sword types, 26 different staffs, and you guessed it right 26 types of maces.\n\n- Crafting & Enchanting Galore\nThe game is all about crafting. There are 300+ recipes available for ambitious blacksmiths, including weapons, armor parts, and jewels. Farm for materials, win battles to receive important ingredients and go straight to the crafting station of the nearest village. Your shiny craft awaits. If you want more power for your crafted items, look for those ultra-rare scrolls of enchanting that will improve the stats of your inventory (up to +15 level). Watch out for the scrolls with a 100% success rate, otherwise, you run the risk of breaking and losing your item if the enchanting fails.\n\n- Astounding Open World\nIn those 256km2 of open land, you will never be bored. Forests, mountains, volcanos, lakes, and rivers, surrounded by fearless monsters that will hunt you down. Fully dynamic weather with seasons, teleports for fast travel, arenas for boss fighting, portals for mysterious dungeons and many quests. Discover villages and castles. Staying on the right areas and entering the matching for you level dungeons & arenas is a wise strategy to strengthen and prepare adequately. You are free to go wherever you go, but if you step foot in the wrong area no one but your weapon can save you.\n\n- Companions\nTBA\n\n- AI PvP with your Companions\nEquip you companions with the best equipment you can and go to sleep, they will fight for you when other AI Companions invade. Or invade other player's companions! TBA\n\n***What TSD doesn't offer***\nTSD is a unique experience, but if you are here for the story, AAA graphics, and quests then that might not be your game. \n\nTSD features a unique system for players that like grinding for loot, crafting, enchanting and being their own master on their world, while at the same time \"interact\" with players via marketplace and other events such as Rift Bosses and Area Progress, in which players do tasks on specific world tiles together, each on their own world, to 100% an area and spawn a Rift boss with shared HP, that everyone fights on their own world and rise in the standings board of contribution.\n\nYou will have your daily quests, and tasks if you want to, grind, craft, enchant your items and go to the billion of dungeons available for extra loot!\n\nAAA graphics, yeah we don't have that either, we are a small team, we use assets by independent developers and we manipulate them to our standards.\n\nTSD is a game that you will either love or hate, good thing is free so you can check out yourself. What we promise is that we do our best to improve the game daily!\n\n***Blockchain Capabilities***\nBlockchain is optional, and it will take time to even find how to have blockchain features in your gameplay, enjoy the game and if you end up wanting something different, TSD has the most deep Web3 implementation ever created, and a unique feature that you can become a Blacksmith renting your recipes knowledge with other players for a fee, just find the Blockchain Village!
