  "longDescription": "# This new content pack introduces Bà Triệu as the leader of Vietnam and Kublai Khan as an alternate leader of either China or Mongolia. \n\n# Includes the Vietnam civilization with Bà Triệu, the Voi Chiến unique unit, and the Thành unique building.\n\nCiv Unique Ability: Vietnam’s unique ability is “Nine Dragon River Delta.” All land specialty districts can only be built on Rainforest, Marsh, or Woods tiles. Buildings on each type of tile receive either additional Science, Production, or Culture. This ability also allows Woods to be planted with the Medieval Faires civic.\n\nLeader Unique Ability: Bà Triệu’s unique ability, “Drive Out the Aggressors,” provides additional Combat Strength for units fighting in Rainforest, Marsh, or Woods tiles; this bonus is further increased for tiles owned by Vietnam. Beginning a turn in Rainforest, Marsh, or Woods also provides additional Movement, which is also further increased for tiles owned by Vietnam.\n\n# Also includes Kublai Khan as an alternate leader for China and Mongolia (requires the Rise and Fall expansion to play as Mongolia.)\n\nLeader Unique Ability: Kublai Khan’s unique ability, “Gerege,” provides one extra Economic policy slot in any government. It also grants a random Eureka and Inspiration when establishing a Trading Post in another civilization’s city for the first time.\nAs a leader of China, Kublai Khan’s science boosts are even more powerful, and his extra policy slot empowers economic strategies. As a leader of Mongolia, Kublai Khan leverages trade routes for military might.\n\n# New “Monopolies and Corporations” Game Mode \n\nThe Vietnam and Kublai Khan pack also introduces the new game mode, Monopolies and Corporations. This optional game mode elevates strategic economic gameplay to a whole new level, offering enticing new rewards based on claiming, acquiring, and exploiting map resources in every era.\n\n# New district and new buildings:\n\nThe Vietnam and Kublai Khan content pack also includes a new district and new buildings",
