  "longDescription": "# Operation Barbarossa begins\n\nAustria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, Holland, Belgium, France. In two short years, all have fallen under German occupation. With the fall of Western Europe, Britain is left isolated and alone. Despite this relentless string of incredible victories, or perhaps because of them, German ambitions have grown dangerously. So much so that Germany plans to violate their non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and launch the largest invasion in the history of warfare into Russia.\n\n# Battle across the Balkans\n\nDespite Yugoslavia signing an agreement to join Germany's Tripartite pact, a coup has overthrown the Yugoslav government! Your forces will now need to fight their way through Yugoslavia before moving to assist Italy in their war against Greece. But the clock is ticking, as Britain uses the struggle in the Balkans as an avenue to challenge German controlled Europe on a new front and Barbarossa is in danger of suffering more postponements...\n\n# Surprise attack on the USSR\n\nOnce Barbarossa is launched, your forces will be called to lead the Axis spearhead against mighty Russia. Swift attacks could disable enemy forces before they even have a chance to respond as your fighters and bombers launch their surprise attacks against Soviet air bases across Eastern Europe. But the Russian bear sleeps lightly, and is likely to be roused to furious anger by the invasion...\n\n# Chapter 4 of the Axis Operations Grand Campaign\n\nTake command of Wehrmacht forces once again in the continuing Axis Operations Campaign for Panzer Corps 2. Re-unite with your loyal command staff and prepare to embark on your longest and most difficult campaign to date with a huge 20 scenario campaign covering actions in the Balkans and Eastern Front of 1941.\n\n# Continue with your own Panzer Corps\n\nPlayers can import their core forces that completed the previous Axis Operations 1940 campaign or use a preset core force to directly launch into the Axis Operations 1941 campaign.\n\n# Missions from history\n\nContinue to explore both obscure and well known battles of World War II through various scenarios and bonus mission objectives taken straight from the pages of history. In addition to normal combat, you'll be tasked with objectives such as witnessing the dramatic fall of the Yugoslavian capital of Belgrade, launching a massive paratrooper operation in Crete, smashing hordes of Soviet aircraft as they sit helplessly on their airfields, and fending off major armored counterattacks as you advance deep into Russia.\n\n# Gain and spend influence\n\nBy completing bonus objectives and achieving various degrees of victory, you'll earn Commendation Points that can be spent on a variety of unique rewards ranging from access to stockpiles of captured enemy equipment, special prototype aircraft, and the chance to recruit more historical officers.\n\n# Eastern Europe invaded\n\nFrom Yugoslavia, to Greece, to Crete, and Russia, players can again expect to encounter a huge variety of adversaries in this campaign.\n\nPlenty of different battlescapes await, as does the ongoing opportunities to capture and field enemy equipment as your own. Be on the lookout for even more historical enemies, as some very recognizable names take up arms to halt your ongoing offensives.\n\n# The Axis Operations continue\n\nThe end of 1941 is not the end of your campaign though, it is merely the latest step. At the conclusion of Axis Operations 1941, players will again be presented with the option to save their core force for use in the next installment of the Axis Operations Campaign.\n\nAny campaign of the Axis Operations can be played individually as a standalone campaign.",
