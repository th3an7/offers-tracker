  "longDescription": "This Soldier Pack includes an Anti-Tank Soldier Specialist. This soldier carries anti-tank gears such as mines and launchers which are sure to induce fear in all tankers.\n\n# Contents\n- Infantry Soldier\n- Tokarev SVT-40\n- Ampulomet Model 1941\n- Tula Tokarev 33\n- TM-35\n- RPG-43\n- GAZ-67\n- 42WLA Lend Lease\n- 7 day Veteran Membership\n- 3x Chauffeur Ribbon Booster\n- 3x Explosives Ribbon Booster\n- 3x Tank destruction Ribbon Booster\n\n# Tokarev SVT-40\nThe SVT-40 is a Soviet semi-automatic rifle. It is a big improvement from the older SVT-38. It fires the hard-hitting 7.62x54mmR ammunition also found in most soviet rifles and machineguns.\n\n# Ampulomet Model 1941\nThe Ampulomet is a 125mm grenade launcher introduced in 1941 to give the infantry a weapon to fight tanks. It uses a special 12 gauge shotgun cartridge to launch a FBM-125 anti-tank grenade easily capable of penetrating 90mm of armor.\n\n# Tula Tokarev 33\nThe TT-33 is a soviet semi-automatic pistol. As with most Russian designs it is simple to manufacture and easy to operate and maintain. It is a formidable weapon, with good penetration and effective range.\n\n# TM-35\nThe TM-35 is a square metal cased Soviet anti-tank mine. When a vehicle drives over it and applies sufficient pressure, the main charge of several 200g blocks of TNT detonates usually destroying the vehicle.\n\n# RPG-43\nThe RPG-43 is a Soviet hand-held anti-tank grenade. It uses a very effective shaped charge HEAT warhead similar to the Panzerfaust. It can penetrate up to 75mm of steel armor making it very dangerous for enemy tank crew.\n\n# GAZ-67\nThe GAZ-67 is a general purpose four-wheel drive vehicle used by the Soviet military. It’s main design has been copied from the American Willys ‘JEEP’. It serves the important role of immediate troop transportation.\n\n# 42WLA Lend Lease\nThe 42WLA is an army motorcycle used for quick transportation of troops or scouting. The motorcycle can be used to get one or two soldiers behind enemy positions for a surprise attack or reconnaissance.\n\n# Veteran Membership\nProgress faster and earn more Credits and Warfunds!\n\n# Ribbon Boosters\nRibbon Boosters will accelerate the progress on all your soldiers during combat. Veteran members will receive the boost on top of the boost from the membership.",
