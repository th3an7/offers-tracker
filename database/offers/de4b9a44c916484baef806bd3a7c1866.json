  "title": "Cities: Skylines - After Dark",
  "description": "Turn your city into a haven for night owls with a host of new policies added in After Dark. Keep commercial zones open 24/7 and let your city’s nightlife thrive!",
  "longDescription": "After Dark is the first expansion to the hugely popular classic city simulation Cities: Skylines. The game expands on the repertoire of features and customizations designed to enhance the thrill as well as maintain the challenge of the city building experience. \n\nDeveloped by Colossal Order and published Paradox Interactive, the central feature of the latest expansion is to utilize the day and night cycle and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night or will your city succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control, the sky is the limit!\n\nUtilize the Day and Night Cycle: The city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. This expansion will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles.\n\n\nLeisure specialization: Commercial areas can specialize in leisure activities. Leisure areas are especially active during the night, but work like regular commercial areas during the day.\n\nTourism specialization: Commercial areas such as bars and restaurants, small marina and fishing tours on the shoreline can specialize in beach activities.\n\nExpanded City Services:\n\nCriminals will now be taken to Prison from Police buildings.\n\nTaxi service will help citizens and tourists travel around the city.\n\nCargo hubs are harbors that accept cargo trains straight to the terminal.\n\nInternational airport is a huge airport, allowing much more traffic than the previous airport and has a metro station attached to it.\n\nBus terminal allows citizens to transfer to other buslines in the terminal building.\n\nNew transportation options: Bikes and dedicated bike lanes and bike ways let citizens opt for a faster alternative to walking. Bus lanes can be used to help the public transportation run smoother.",
