Manage personnel, build colonies throughout the solar system. Extract resources, research,trade and complete tasks\n<!--text-->\n*In the middle of the 21st century, humanity faced a shortage of resources on planet Earth and the leading space powers turned their attention to space. You will lead a private space corporation and begin industrial development of the Solar System.*\n\n### Scales\nDiscover the vast expanses of the Solar System - from the hot Mercury to the icy Kuiper Belt. Explore the mysterious landscapes of the planets and their satellites: from the endless deserts of Venus to the Martian canyons, from the volcanoes of Io to the icy shell of Europa. Create dozens of colonies, orbital stations and spaceships capable of accommodating hundreds of colonists.\n\n### Colonies\nCreate and develop extraterrestrial colonies with a variety of specializations: from spaceports and mining settlements to farming and tourist complexes, as well as scientific colonies and majestic space stations. Use a simple and powerful construction mechanism to bring your boldest architectural ideas to life. Extract minerals and create production chains, starting with simple resources and gradually moving on to more complex and high-tech products. Hold elections in the colonies to take into account the opinions of residents and pass laws reflecting the dominant ideology.\n\n### Personnel\nEach astronaut is a unique individual with his own character, worldview, professional skills and experience. As experience and qualifications grow, the need for decent wages and comfortable living conditions increases. Colonists, like all people, need to satisfy basic needs: food, sleep, rest and personal hygiene. Particular attention must be paid to the health of the settlers. Timely treatment and care for the injured and sick will ensure their survival and well-being.\n\n### Logistics\nYou will have dozens of unique game resources at your disposal, and mineral deposits will be scattered unevenly across the planets. Create and optimize a logistics network with an efficient shuttle system that will transport cargo and personnel between colonies and spaceports. Conclude contracts and trade with all game nations.\n\n### Harsh conditions\nSpace is a hostile place for humans: the temperature varies greatly depending on the time of day and time of year and depends on the location of the colony on the planet, the presence of an atmosphere and the distance to the Sun. The radiation background varies on different celestial bodies and increases during solar flares. Meteor showers pose a serious threat to colonies and orbital stations. And on planets with an active atmosphere, storms and calms periodically occur, disrupting logistics and affecting electricity generation.\n\n### Research and technology\nThis path will not be easy, but science and technology will help to overcome all difficulties. Produce new high-tech resources to create increasingly complex equipment and better building structures. Use powerful engines and wireless power transmission to colonize the most remote corners of the Solar System. Explore space farming and cuisine for a varied diet and greater comfort for astronauts, and space tourism for additional income. And also robots, clones, force fields and much more!\n\n**The Solar System awaits you in Solargene!**\n",
