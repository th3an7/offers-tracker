  "longDescription": "# About 3DMark Speed Way\n\n3DMark Speed Way is a DirectX 12 Ultimate benchmark for gaming PCs running Windows 10 and 11. Speed Way’s engine was assembled to demonstrate the new performance optimizations DirectX 12 Ultimate brings to ray-traced gaming.\n\nSpeed Way uses new DirectX 12 Ultimate performance optimizations like Mesh Shaders, with DirectX Raytracing Tier 1.1 used for real-time global illumination and real-time ray-traced reflections. Find out if your PC is ready for the next generation of gaming.\n\nFreely explore the Speed Way scene in interactive mode. You can adjust camera focus settings, change the lighting settings, and use the built-in capture tool to help compare the visual effects of the latest ray tracing techniques.\n\n3DMark Speed Way was developed with input from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and other leading technology companies.\n\n# New VS. Mode\n\nUse VS. mode to see and compare how your PC is performing during a Speed Way benchmark run. Get performance metrics while you benchmark or add another Speed Way result for comparison.\n\nVS. mode lets you benchmark against Speed Way runs from your friends, the 3DMark Hall of Fame, or PCs with the latest gaming hardware. Check if the performance of your gaming PC has changed over time by using VS. mode with your previous Speed Way results.\n\n# Speed Way Stress Test\n\nCheck the reliability and stability of your system after buying or building a new PC, upgrading your graphics card, or overclocking your GPU. Stress testing can also identify faulty hardware and a need for better cooling.\n\n# AMD FSR feature test\n\nThis feature test was developed in partnership with AMD. \n\nFidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) is an AMD graphics technology that uses highly-optimized spatial and temporal analytical techniques to improve performance while maintaining high visual fidelity. AMD FSR 2 is open source and runs on a wide range of GPUs from all vendors.\n\nThe 3DMark AMD FSR feature test shows you how AMD FSR 2 affects performance. The 3DMark frame inspector tool helps you compare image quality with a side-by-side view of AMD FSR 2 and native-resolution rendering.\n\n# Speed Way system requirements\n\n**OS:** Windows 11 or Windows 10, 64-bit (Version 21H2)\n**Processor:** 1.8 GHz dual-core with SSSE3 support\n**Memory:** 4GB RAM\n**Graphics:** Graphics card with DirectX 12 Ultimate support*\n**Graphics Memory**: 6GB VRAM\n**Storage:** 1.65 GB of free space\n\n*To run the AMD FSR feature test, you must have a GPU that supports Shader Model 6.0 or later, and AMD FSR 2 or later. FSR 2 is an open-source technology developed by AMD, supporting a wide range of GPUs across all vendors. For more information, please see the 3DMark User guide",
