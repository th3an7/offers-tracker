In all play sessions, both players will retain all loot, 100% vigor, and have the ability to revive each other.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Free Friend’s Pass\n<!--text-->\nInvite any friend to join your adventure in online co-op even if they don’t own the game. Friends will retain all loot and character progression between online sessions, and have free offline access to the full tutorial and character creator.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Revamped Combat & Movement\n<!--text-->\nV2.0 introduces a fully revamped character movement and combat system, including more precise attack animations and improved weapon responsiveness, more effective evasions, a refined lock-on system, new grievous strike button prompts, and more.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Dedicated Jump Button\n<!--text-->\nPlayers can now jump at any time with a single button press allowing for much more intuitive platforming.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Full Weapon Audio Overhaul\n<!--text-->\nEvery weapon now delivers a richer, more impactful soundscape, amplifying every swing, parry, and block for a more immersive and satisfying combat experience.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Overhauled Character Creator\n<!--text-->\nCraft more realistic and visually striking characters with improved facial detail, body shapes, and overall visual fidelity for both male and female models.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Modernized UI & HUD Options\n<!--text-->\nA new user interface is cleaner and easier to navigate, while you can now also disable the HUD for a more immersive experience or use the dynamic HUD setting, where it fades in and out based on gameplay.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Improved Tutorial Experience\n<!--text-->\nThe updated tutorial offers clearer, more intuitive instructions. Additionally, a new in-game guidebook means you can reference previous prompts at any time throughout your adventure.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Umbral Lamp Guidance\n<!--text-->\nYour Umbral lamp now has the ability to highlight the path towards your next vestige point, aiding lost crusaders through the winding passages of Mournstead.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n**Lords of the Fallen** introduces an all-new, epic RPG adventure in a vast, interconnected world more than five times larger than the original game. \n\nAfter an age of the cruellest tyranny, the demon God, Adyr, was finally defeated. But Gods… do not fall forever. Now, aeons later, Adyr’s resurrection draws nigh. As one of the fabled Dark Crusaders, journey through both the realms of the living and the dead in this expansive RPG experience, featuring colossal boss battles, fast challenging combat, thrilling character encounters, and deep, immersive storytelling.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Explore A Vast, Interconnected World\n<!--text-->\nJourney across two expansive, parallel worlds - the world of the living and the dead - with each harbouring its own pathways, secrets, treasures… and foes.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Master Fast, Challenging Combat\n<!--text-->\nChoose from 100s of unique weapons, from heavy-hitting flails to rapid-fire crossbows, or forgo metal for magic with devastating attacks of the arcane.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Unite in Online Multiplayer\n<!--text-->\nExperience the campaign alone, or unite with other players in full ‘shared progression’ online co-op. Provided you and your companion are on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough and have defeated a similar number of main bosses within a margin of one, both players will save all mainline progress. Or invite any friend who doesn't own the game to adventure by your side using the Free Friend’s Pass.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Customise your Journey\n<!--text-->\nWith the Advanced Game Modifier System, fully customise your gaming experience, including enemy density, randomised loot, pre-upgraded weapons, permadeath, and more.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Define Your Legend\n<!--text-->\nPersonalise your character’s appearance before selecting one of nine varied character classes. Whichever starting path you take, develop your own playstyle by upgrading stats and weapons.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Post-Launch Updates\n<!--text-->\nOver 50 post-launch updates have been released, vastly improving the experience with significant performance enhancements, rigorous difficulty balancing in response to player feedback, multiple new questlines, enhanced combat and character movement,  and a number of new Quality-of-Life features.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Key Features:\n<!--text-->\n- Journey across two vast, parallel worlds\n- Fully customise your experience with the Advanced Gameplay Modifier System (immediately available)\n- Master a fast, fluid and challenging combat system \n- Overcome epic and colossal boss battles \n- Wield devastating magic attacks and character buffs\n- Adventure side by side in full ‘shared progression’; online co-op with crossplay functionality\n- Invite a second player to join your campaign in uninterrupted, online multiplayer\n- Play with any friend who doesn’t own the game with the Free Friend’s Pass (only host saves progress)\n- Fully customise your own unique character \n- Choose from 9 starting character classes, including Knight, Rogue and Fire Apprentice\n- Replay any boss in ‘Echoes of Battle’ mode (accessed at any vestige)\n- Face the ultimate boss-rush challenge in ‘Crucible’ mode (accessed at any vestige)\n",
