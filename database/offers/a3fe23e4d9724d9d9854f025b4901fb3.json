Take competition to the next level in Match-making and Leagues, tweak a wide range of options in custom Lobbies, or play any part of the single-player content in co-op with up to 4 other players.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Varied and Historically Accurate Units\n<!--text-->\nFrom nigh-indestructible tanks, devastating artillery, and nimble airplanes to realistic models of infantry armament and military equipment, Men of War II features the most extensive and highly detailed WWII locations, vehicles, and characters roster in the series to date: three armies, 45 customizable battalions, and close to 400 different units await your commands.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Stunning Visuals and Captivating Sound Design\n<!--text-->\nExperience the classical theater of war from a new perspective: every location comes to life with a unique set of fully destructible objects, realistic physics, and immersive sound design.
