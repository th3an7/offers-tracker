  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Escape Samsara\n<!--text-->\n### *“Life is dukkha”* - the Buddha\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-3ipta](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-3ipta.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nIn the intermediate state between this life and the next, await strange and terrifying visions that reveal to you the true nature of reality: impermanence. Are you enlightened enough to recognise the true nature of reality and reach Nirvana?\n\nIn the dying recesses of your mind, endlessly pressured by an imagined world that seeks to destroy you, will you learn what it takes to reach Nirvana, or will you be trapped forever, born again into endless suffering?\n\nSamsara is a game of cycles that fuses Buddhist themes with souls-like gameplay in a tight and replayable action-adventure RPG. In Buddhism, Samsara is the cycle of death and rebirth to which all life is bound. Your ultimate goal is to escape from this cyclic existence - to **escape Samsara**.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Gameplay Pillars\n<!--text-->\n### 1. Rebirth\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-1louj](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-1louj.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nEverything in Samsara is bound to a cycle of life, death and rebirth - from your avatar to the world itself. Through the [Karma](https://wiki.infinity27.com/app/page/1pscVrBFKbS2gSeqoxuS8W9srkJaOrKRg05-FWniwkhY?p=1AzOOgioG8y4MVX1XC56Y47AEIk_cH5Ij) system, you will reincarnate as different avatars after death, based on the actions of your past life. You lose everything, but you gain so much more. Death is not defeat in Samsara, but it is how you progress.\n\nChoices in combat, dialogue and exploration grant you both positive and negative Karma, which crystallises into Karmic Seeds upon death, which you use to acquire new skills, equipment and perks in the next life. **Death is not the end.**\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-1s5un](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-1s5un.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nUpon death, the karma gained in your previous life results in your rebirth as one of 7 different avatars that span the range of karmic balance…\n\n**Manusya** - Symbolic of hope and closest to karmic harmony. To be a human is to stand at the hub of fate’s wheel. Those whose karma has not yet pulled them far from where they began will take on this balanced form.\n**Deva** - Pristine, deific beings residing in the heavens atop Mt Meru. Those who distinguish themselves with acts of mercy and kindness are reborn as the Deva, who glide lightly through the air and boast a deep well of magical power.\n**Asura** - Wrathful demi-gods known for their fiery tempers and prowess in battle. Imposing and impassioned. Righteous fury incarnate, the multi-armed Asura grows more powerful as their being diminishes.\n**Naraka** - Vindictive, devious punishers. Those who walk a path of violence or ill-will are attuned to and revel in punishment and suffering. Hellish beings wielding fearsome and potent combat abilities that allow them to obliterate foes even at a distance.\n**Tiryag** - Animalistic, impulsive and instinctive. Their apparent simplicity and ignorance are belied by keen instincts that help them sense unseen foes and augment their focus in the heat of battle.\n**Preta** - Avarice manifest. The sorry fate of these beings is to know hunger unending, even in places of abundance. Their greed requires them to sustain their life at the expense of others but leads them to treasures most would miss.\n**Bodhisattva** - A fully enlightened being of unequivocal compassion and a capacity for unlimited service to the world. One who had the chance to attain Nirvana but renounced it to perfect themselves and lead others to the path of enlightenment.\n\nEach new life offers a new opportunity. Learn to let go of the past. Accept your fate. Find a way to **escape Samsara**.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n### 2. Conflict\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-w4rrc](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-w4rrc.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nVanquish your enemies in souls-like action combat that is easy to learn but rewarding to master. \n\nDodge, parry, block and strike precisely to build Focus, which both protects you and gives you more power to overcome even the toughest challenges. Build Focus faster through the use of Mantras, magical chants that imbue special effects, and unlock Mudras, hand-gestures which allow you to unleash even more powerful spells and abilities.\n\nBecome a master of many arms - both physical and magical - with a diverse selection of weapon types, spells and elemental effects that you must learn to utilise to succeed in combat. Customise your avatar’s build using equipment and skills that you can gain by defeating enemies, finding treasures hidden in dangerous corners of the world, or engaging in discourse with those you meet on your journey.\n\n**Death is not the end.** Choose the path of violence or that of pacifism, to end conflict decisively and reap the Karma of your actions.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n### 3. Discourse\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-1y136](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-1y136.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nSamsara takes place in the intermediate state between death and life. It is a spiritual journey. Samsara is not a place in time or space. It is a manifestation of the dying mind. Nobody lives there but the beings you encounter, both terrifying and benevolent, are manifestations of your own Karma.\n\nConverse with these fragments of your dying self, which appear as apparitions of strangers in dire circumstances. Listen to their pleas, or ignore them. In your quest to **escape Samsara**, you will encounter many moral dilemmas, not just problems easily solved with violence or ignorance. These are the Challenges of Mara, the tempter, who seeks to lead you from the path of enlightenment to darker outcomes. In the face of your death will you choose to aid them or conquer them, to gain their help or to take their power, in pursuit of your goals?\n\n**Death is not the end.** You can choose, and you can change - but many paths will lead you back into the cycle.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n### 4. Exploration\n\n<!--image-->\n![Samsara-hwac0](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/62091a72ead4422abdcce47d78f24425/samsara-hwac0.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe world of Kāmadhātu - the “Desire Realm” - exists only as a vision created within your mind. It appears to you as a deadly and dying world at the end of time, at the end of its cycle.\n\nMeditate on spectacular vistas as you adventure across interconnected dreamscapes that are hostile towards you: filled with terrifying hallucinations of violent enemies that seek to tear you apart, cryptic characters whose motives are unclear, and deadly traps that will ensnare and destroy you. Fractal anomalies reveal non-euclidian shortcuts, and traversable portals connecting far places.\n\nClimb, fight and evade danger as you traverse the world. Mt Meru at its centre, flanked in the cardinal directions by the Four Great Continents, separated by vast bodies of water and encircled by impassable mountain ranges. Traverse dense tropical jungle and ancient ruins, cross scorching dunes of a sunken oasis, trek up a glistening ice and gem-encrusted mountain, and leap between precarious perches high above the serene lakes of a seemingly abundant paradise.\n\nWill you seek enlightenment to ascend to the domain of the gods atop the mysterious and sacred Mt. Meru, or choose to fight legions as you descend beneath layers of frozen and fiery hells to reach the gold-laden deep root of the world?\n\n**Death is not the end.** Find a way to **escape Samsara** before the inevitable end.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Support the Next Generation of Game Development Talent\n<!--text-->\nSamsara is brought to you by INFINITY27, a small indie team with a vision to open the games industry to the next wave of aspiring talent.
