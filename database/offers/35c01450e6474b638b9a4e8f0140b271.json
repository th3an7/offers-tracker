  "description": "Nestled at the foot of the Southern Alps, Te Awaroa National Park is home to both temperate beech forests and steep alpine peaks. While some are drawn here in search of Sika Deer, others come to trace its trails of history.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nFor generations, Te Awaroa National Park has captured the imagination of movie directors and hunters alike. The rolling hills, temperate rainforests, and deciduous forests combine to create a microcosm of the entire South Island of New Zealand. While hunters make their way here in search of Sika Deer, Chamois, and Feral Goats, Te Awaroa has also seen an influx of tourism due to the movies recently filmed in the area. It’ll be up to you and warden Kiri Taylor to ensure that no permanent damage is done to the splendour of the reserve, and that its native flora and fauna are preserved.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# TE AWAROA’S FAUNA\n<!--text-->\n\nTracking the numerous animals that roam Te Awaroa’s stunningly diverse environments is a favourite among hunters. For some, it’s the rush of stalking a prized Sika Deer in the beech forest that draws them here, while others come in hopes of catching a rare glimpse of the Feral Pigs, Feral Goats, and Chamois. And for those looking for a more relaxed experience, there’s plenty of Red Deer, Turkey, European Rabbits and Fallow Deer to hunt.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# THE NEW ZEALAND FLORA\n<!--text-->\n\nIt’s of no surprise that Te Awaroa has been used to depict fairytale landscapes, as it's ever-changing ecosystems are truly a sight to behold. From the steep, impressive mountains that divide the reserve, to the sparkling beaches and dense temperate forests, the region transforms under your very feet. There are also more familiar hunting grounds available, such as spruce and pine forests.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# VERSATILE SURPLUS RIFLE\n<!--text-->\n\nWhat the F.L. Sporter .303 lacks in condition, it more than makes up for in performance. The bolt action is smooth, reliable and easy to cycle, and it’s a proven rifle for both hunting and target practice. With a wide selection of compatible sights, and a great effective range, it can take down a broad selection of animals without problem.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# MISSIONS AND MEASURES\n<!--text-->\n\nStretching across 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), Te Awaroa has always been a place to get away from it all. Times are tough though, and when warden Kiri Taylor reluctantly agrees to allow a series of Hollywood films to be made in the reserve, it goes from sleepy backwater to daytripper hotspot almost overnight. \n\nWith the reserve's delicate ecology threatened, Kiri has had enough. It's time to show the world that New Zealand isn’t all just haka and halflings. Across 16 new story missions, you’ll deal with local menaces and discover the truth behind a long-forgotten legend.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# SHARE THE EXPERIENCE\n<!--text-->\n\nYou can hunt in the reserve even if you don’t own the DLC by joining someone in multiplayer who does. This will give you access to everything except the narrative missions.\n",
