  "title": "Forgive Me Father Soundtrack",
  "description": "Forgive Me Father has heartpounding soundtrack which blends metal and other musical styles and helps create the game's unique atmosphere - now you can listen to it even when you're not running around killing Lovecraftian abominations!",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nForgive Me Father may just as well be the first Lovecraftian game where the somber sounds of violin get replaced with METAL (it probably isn’t, but still - it’s a rare combination). In a way, it’s our homage to the soundtrack of old, where you had kickass metal tunes in 2.5 shooters. However, pure metal would be boring. Fortunately, the soundtrack was composed by the talented Tim Fialka, who knew this and properly spiced it up. So instead of just guitars and drums, you can hear orchestral and electronic bits too. We do hope it sounds unique to you - Lovecraftian, but not in a generic manner.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n01 - Forgive me, Father! - 3:33\n02 - Another devilish trick - 2:56\n03 - Welcome To Pestisville - 2:13\n04 - Welcome To Pestisville Pt.2 - 2:11\n05 - Good Time For You to Get Angry - 2:21\n06 - The night is dark - 4:20\n07 - Just don't look down - 4:36\n08 - They will be looking for you - 1:14\n09 - Fish & Tear - 4:04\n10 - I am so serious - 1:16\n11 - Strong drugs - 1:00\n12 - Sweetie, Get Me Bazooka - 1:59\n13 - Ca'tharsis - 3:24\n14 - Death Is Equitable - 1:48\n15 - It's only the beginning - 6:09\n16 - Perpetual Dream - 3:46\n17 - Wet ritual - 3:20\n18 - Wet ritual Pt.2 - 2:50\n19 - Falling rocks - 1:26\n20 - Mad hope - 4:21\n21 - Azyzz - 2:21\n22 - Rain and pain - 5:18\n23 - Corn Dance - 1:00\n24 - A Crow's Breakfast - 1:30\n25 - Time to play the game - 3:06\n26 - Time to play the game Pt.2 - 4:04\n27 - Forgiveness Is Divine - 2:13\n28 - In memory of Ca'tharsis - 4:53\n29 - Black alert - 1:30\n30 - Lab Busters - 4:12\n31 - Sudden Fear - 2:14\n32 - Madness Factory - 5:30\n33 - Gobbler's song - 1:36\n34 - Big Ugly Fish - 3:57\n35 - Silence Scream - 3:50\n36 - Giant's shadow - 2:06\n37 - No time to bleed - 2:12\n38 - Swallow the Stars - 4:06\n39 - Swallow the Stars Pt.2 - 3:24\n40 - Ghosts everywhere - 3:30\n41 - Drums in the deep - 1:36\n42 - And where you went, rest vanished - 2:08\n43 - Glitch - 5:53\n44 - See yourself - 3:32\n45 - Waltz with my insanity - 3:38\n46 - Rise of Cthulhu - 3:22\n",
