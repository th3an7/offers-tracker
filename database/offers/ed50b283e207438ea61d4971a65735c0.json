The AdsorptionBoole acts as an attachable vector for quickly opening doors and windows on Rail walls.</li><li><strong>WallMode</strong>:When checked, it prevents floor generation, only generating open Rails and Posts along the spline, primarily for internal wall functions.</li><li><strong>HandleMode</strong>:When enabled, it allows for quick sampling into Box or equilateral polygon shapes based on the Handle&#39;s position, primarily for creating internal wall passages, building exteriors, and Blockout rooms.</li><li><strong>Building Functionality</strong>:Allows the design of single-layer Rails to be sampled into multi-layer building modes, enabling rapid creation of buildings.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p><strong>BP_EasySairs Updates:</strong>You can now create simple stairs with Rail and Post functionality, which can be exported as static meshes and imported directly into your game after adjusting the lightmap.</p><p><strong>Stairwell BP:</strong>Quickly create stairwells and folding stairs, with wall attachment Boolean functionality, allowing shape adjustments via handles to fit various stairwell designs.</p><p><strong>RunTime Updates:</strong>Added a BP with “RT”, allowing dynamic mesh actors to function in “Standalone Game” mode. Previous BPs could not be used in “Standalone Game,” but static meshes can be baked directly.</p><p><br /></p><h4>Product Functionality Positioning Update:</h4><p>This product is primarily positioned for architectural visualization, landscape design, quick Blockout tool creation, and for hand-drawn, retro-style, casual games that do not require baked static lighting. Since dynamic mesh actors cannot bake static lighting, static meshes exported from BPs must be dismantled and their lightmap UVs recreated to bake lighting correctly.</p><p>Additionally, this asset will be gradually developed into a comprehensive multifunctional toolkit for the PMB system, with future development focusing on adding prop builders like the stairwell BP. Please leave your feedback on this asset for any additional feature requests.</p><p>———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p><br /></p><p>Features: Dynamic mesh blocks are generated by the closed spline shape, and parametric attachments can be added according to the spline line: wrapping edges, walls, railings and connections between railings.</p><p><br /></p><p>Uses: Alien Flat, Park Square and ground, urban sidewalk ground, alien room, flower bed, Blockout</p><p>Design intention: In the game we need a large number of platforms, such as squares, urban ground, etc., these shapes need to be manually modeled, in the past workflow, if the shape of these squares according to the visual effects or game content needs to be modified, especially after the addition of post attachments. So we made this platform system that can be modified in real time according to the spline, and at the same time can indent along the spline to generate the railing. Allows players to quickly build squares of various shapes. As a function of the extension, it can also be directly and quickly made of various shapes of flower beds, walkways and the like.</p><p><br /></p><p>Implementation method: Based on the &#34;dynamic mesh&#34; main BP and related main functions, a large number of dynamic mesh construction functions are created. After careful design, it can be used quickly and easily with a variety of perfect functions</p><p><br /></p><p>Platform function: According to the closed spline, the dynamic mesh body is extruded in the vertical direction, the edge can be indented inside and outside, multiple can be added, and the Boolean hole can be dug according to the shape, which is used as the ground or ceiling.</p><p>Rail function: According to the closed spline to generate a ring dynamic mesh body, can be used as a wall around the spline, can add multiple groups, can also add square or dome square doors or Windows for digging holes.</p><p>Post function: According to the closed spline path to place programmatic post or custom static grid body post, can set spacing and indentation, can also be overlaid adjustment single or shield.</p><p>Dynamic material: The PMB main material can be used to adjust the mapping, color offset, brightness, gloss and other parameters of each module in the instance in real time.</p><p>Preset function: You can store the designed style as a preset asset file for easy re-call.</p><p>Sampling function: The specified spline points can be sampled as road, arc sampling, triangle, square and circle sampling, right Angle sampling and staircase sampling.</p>",
