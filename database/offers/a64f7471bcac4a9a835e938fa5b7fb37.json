  "title": "Total War: WARHAMMER III — Thrones of Decay",
  "description": "The Thrones of Decay pack introduces 3 new Legendary Lords, for Nurgle, the Empire, and the Dwarfs, usable in both the Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns.  ",
  "longDescription": "Embrace conflict, ingenuity, and decay with a new suite of Legendary Lords, Heroes, Units, and Mechanics to enhance your campaign roster on and off the battlefield. Tamurkhan the Maggot Lord, Elspeth von Draken, and Malakai Makaisson arrive in Total War: WARHAMMER III. They bring unique campaign mechanics to their respective races, with a brand-new objective in Realm of Chaos independent from the Ursun storyline, plus new Units and Legendary Heroes to help them achieve total victory and secure the Nemesis Crown.\n\n- 3 new Legendary Lords join the battle.\n- Gather Chieftains from powerful factions across the known world and become the ultimate Warlord of Nurgle as Tamurkhan, The Maggot Lord.\n- Embrace the strengths of magic and gunpowder with Nuln’s Imperial Gunnery School, serving Elspeth von Draken.\n- Seek a glorious death, reap the rewards, and test your latest innovations as Malakai Makaisson.\n- Improve your odds with 3 new Legendary Heroes, 15 Units, 3 Lords, 3 Heroes, and a further 9 Regiments of Renown. \n\n# THRONES OF DECAY\n\nNURGLE\n\nTAMURKHAN, THE MAGGOT LORD\n\nTamurkhan, the Maggot Lord and Champion of Nurgle, is one of the greatest Chaos warlords to ever afflict the known world. A mighty leader to some, and a bloated corpse-worm to others, those that stand against Tamurkhan quickly fall under the banner of this bringer of desolation.\n\nAs a hard-hitting tank with the strength of an Ogre and the vigour of Nurgle’s greatest combatants, Tamurkhan rides into battle atop his unique Toad Dragon, Bubebolos, to unleash rot on any that dare oppose the Warlord. \n\nTamurkhan’s crusade across the land is not merely one of destruction or decay, for he amasses a horde of heroic characters as he goes, absorbing the many strengths of those that could not defeat him. These heroic characters, Chieftains, are added to his ever-growing empire once Tamurkhan has displayed his true dominating power, granting the Maggot Lord a suite of champions and warriors for use in his grand crusade.\n\nWith enough devoted Chieftains under his wing, Tamurkhan can pursue ultimate victory.\n\n# THE EMPIRE\n\nELSPETH VON DRAKEN\n\nElspeth von Draken, the Dark Lady of Nuln, is a respected advisor to the Elector Counts and instrumental at keeping the plagues of Nurgle at bay. As a magistrix of the Amethyst Order, the Graveyard Rose may be all that stands in the Maggot Lord’s way.\n\nAs a powerful spellcaster, Elspeth von Draken soars across the skies on her Carmine Dragon, with a strong helping of magical mastery under her belt.\n\nElspeth von Draken is committed to protecting the Empire by any means necessary, and her alliance with Nuln has allowed her to help support the forces of the Empire in a unique way. The true potential of the Empire’s gunpowder units can be unleashed with Nuln’s Imperial Gunnery School, furthering the weaponry of the Empire. To do this, magic and black powder can no longer be separate entities, and instead must work together to ensure the forces of Chaos are kept at bay. \n\nElspeth's patronage will go a long way in helping to develop the next stage of technological advancement, as she also offers her unique talents to combine her mastery of Death magic into the munitions of the Imperial Gunnery School, creating a combined arms force of Amythest units the foes of the Empire will regret crossing.\n\n# DWARFS\n\nMALAKAI MAKAISSON\n\nHaving been ejected from the Engineer’s guild after a series of catastrophic malfunctions that cost the lives of many a Dwarf, Malakai Makaisson took the Slayer’s oath and continues to engineer grand machines to this day, assisted by his entourage of Slayers. One day, he hopes to overcome this shame by seeking a glorious death in battle, so at last he may be seen as a true inventor of incredible works, and a legend of his time.\n\nWith a fascination for creating grand machines, Malakai is a ranged support character, damaging from afar with his guns, bombs, artillery, and the most deranged of munitions to whittle down his opponents.\n\nMalakai craves nigh-unwinnable battles and fights with mighty foes. As a Slayer, he seeks out these worthy combatants to atone for his sins, but as an Engineer, he sees it as an opportunity to learn new tricks, advance his equipment, and crush all that stand before him in the name of progress. \n\nWith Malakai’s Adventures, Makaisson aims to prove himself in combat, or die trying. \n\n# NEW UNITS\n\nCommand the battlefield from your throne with additional units for Nurgle, the Empire, and the Dwarfs.\n\nSpread decay with the Toad Dragons of Nurgle, set sail as the Empire with the Marienburg Land Ship, and rain destruction from the skies as the Dwarfs with the Thunderbarge. \n\nPlus, further creations await within the Thrones of Decay.",
