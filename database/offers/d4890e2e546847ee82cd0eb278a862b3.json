  "longDescription": "A series of 7 new missions tell the story of the struggle on planet Gehenna - an unforgiving hellscape engulfed in molten lava, volcanic eruptions, and hordes of Arachnids. \n\nHuman interest in the sector is centered on Vilon Station, a majestic space station orbiting just above the planet’s atmosphere. A stream of massive freighters feed the station’s endless thirst for fuel, extracted and refined through industrial facilities on Gehenna’s surface.\n\nBeing located in the center of profitable trade routes between the planets Earth, Kwalasha and other Federation colonies, Vilon Station serves a vital nexus for commerce, refueling and resupply.\n\nUntil now, the protection of personnel on Gehenna has been in the hands of contracted mercenary groups, composed of gritty veterans and adventurers. With the expanding fronts of the Bug War however, Arachnid hostility has been sharply escalating. In light of this perilous situation, Vilon Station’s director has implored the Sky Marshal to dispatch the Mobile Infantry to Gehenna. \n\nTheir mission: to take over from the mercenaries and safeguard humanity against the ravenous Bug hordes!\n\n# Additional Tools & Firepower\n\nNew Mercenary and Vilon Station units:\n\n- Engineering Biped\nWhile not initially designed for combat, the solid structure of this bipedal vehicle has proven effective as an improvised frontline defense against Arachnid attacks. Its drilling arm can screw up any Bug that dares to come near, and through creative use of the machine's fuel system it can lay down screens of smog and fire.\n\n- Frag Mercs\nThese mercenaries specialize with a weapon that can fire both fragmentation shells for devastating close range barrages and contact grenades for medium range, indirect fire support. Experienced “Frag Mercs” are often skilled in the deployment of various types of landmines.\n\n- Shredder Mercs\nCarried by the biggest, toughest mercenaries, the “Shredder” portable minigun can effectively mow down swaths of Bugs and can even rip through the armor of the larger Arachnids. The heavy weapon can also be mounted on a tripod for increased accuracy and rate of fire.\n\nNew Mobile Infantry units:\n\n- Powered Suit Incinerators\nAching for more firepower, these experimental squads of Powered Suit Troopers have been equipped with powerful flamethrowers. Useful whenever you need to wipe a room of Bugs!\n\n- Powered Suit Officer\nThese officers wear the same advanced exoskeleton armor as the elite powered suit troopers. It provides them with excellent mobility and protection to direct fire missions and call in reinforcements in the hottest of battlegrounds. \n\n# Evolved Arachnids\n\nThe Arachnids on Gehenna have evolved into several distinct subspecies that are especially adapted to the infernal environment. Federal Intelligence has publicly released intel report about these new Bug threats:\n\n- Stinger\nA small, fragile Bug that launches heated projectiles. They may not appear very threatening individually but are often encountered in numbers, especially around their towering nests.\n\n- Immolator\nThese monstrosities eject an incendiary substance that burns everything it touches. Battlefield reports have shown the Bug to burst into flames when mortally wounded, causing it to charge forward before exploding in a big ball of fire.\n\n- Pyrofly\nA flying bug that can hover and spray an area with a burning substance. Due to its thick exoskeleton, the Bug is difficult to destroy with standard rifle fire.\n\n- Bomberbee\nSmall flying Bugs who will dive into their enemy and explode on impact. The violent explosion can rip a man in half and punch through armor plating.",
