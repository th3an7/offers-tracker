  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Hold your breath\n<!--text-->\nSubnautica 2 is an underwater survival adventure game set on an all-new alien ocean world. It is the next chapter in the Subnautica universe, developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\n**New World, New Adventure**\nA new world awaits alongside an all-new story. You are a pioneer traveling to a distant world, but something is amiss. The ship's AI insists you carry on the mission. This world is too dangerous for humans to survive… Unless you change what it means to be human. What creatures, intelligent or otherwise, await your arrival?\n\n**Explore with Friends**\nPlay alone or with up to three friends in online multiplayer co-op. Whether exploring mysterious ruins, building custom bases, or adventuring deeper into the world… The challenge of this planet will test your ingenuity and ability to adapt, in unexpected and curious ways.\n\n**Craft Submersibles, Tools, and Bases**\nSurvival depends on utilizing the right tools. Alongside basic items such as your Scanner and Flashlight, you’ll find recipes for more advanced tools, equipment, and submersibles. Bases are more customizable with an overhauled building system. New tools allow for greater adaptation to the world.\n\n**Uncover Diverse New Biomes**\nFrom towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields, this aquatic alien world is brimming with vibrant and breathtaking biomes, each teeming with diverse ecosystems and unique creatures. But something isn’t right. The world is out of balance. What happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you? \n\n**Study Mysterious Lifeforms**\nUncover a rich world full of mysterious lifeforms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. Scan creatures to learn more about them and take samples for study. As you learn more about this world, evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival. \n\n**Survive Terrifying Depths**\nThis world is vast and deep. Venture beyond the safety of shallow waters, descending into a dark unknown. Wonder and danger lurks around every corner. To survive this planet, you’ll need to push beyond your boundaries and unlock the secrets of this strange world. \n\n**About the Team**\nSubnautica 2 is being created by Unknown Worlds, a fully remote studio that traces its roots back to the 2002 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. It is the same studio that created the original Subnautica. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, Iceland, Austria, Australia, Canada, India, and many more places.\n\n**Early Access Development**\nSubnautica 2 will be an Early Access game meaning it will be in active development at release. You may encounter bugs, in-development features, and performance issues. We will be adding additional biomes, creatures, craftables, and narrative as we proceed. Join us in Early Access and help shape the future of Subnautica 2.\n",
