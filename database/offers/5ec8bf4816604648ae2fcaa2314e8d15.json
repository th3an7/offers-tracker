  "longDescription": "# MOTHER OSTANKYA \n\nFor years we thought she was a child's tale to frighten us into behaving. Then one day, in my twentieth winter, I got too close to the woods. And when I was told Mother Ostankya would get you... I knew if I took one step closer to the trees it would be true. \n\nThis pack introduces Mother Ostankya, a new Legendary Lord for Kislev, usable in both Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns, as well as new units, characters, and regiments of renown.\n\n• Conjure powerful hexes and incantations whilst engaging in witchcraft, flipping campaigns on their head as Mother Ostankya of Kislev.  \n• Fight for Kislev with The Golden Knight, the finest warrior from among the ranks of the Druzhina.\n​​• ​Expand your roster with 5 additional  units, and enhance your troops with 3 new Regiments of Renown, including the Things in the Woods, Hag Witches, and the giant Frost Wyrm.\n\nTales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the Kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. Mother Ostankya is real. A guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. When war comes to her door, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of Kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them. \n\nAnd if you cross her path, make no mistake. Mother Ostankya will punish you. \n\nAs a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, Mother Ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid. \n\n# THE WITCH’S HUT \n\nThe Daughters of the Forest must infuse Mother Ostankya’s Witchcraft at the Witch’s Hut. With a new rare resource, Spirit Essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent Incantations and utilise Hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign.  \n\nForce enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the Malediction of Ruin; Mother Ostankya’s final Hex to secure the sanctity of Kislevite land. \n\n# NEW UNITS \n\nNew Kislevite units lurk in these woods. \n\nA terrible and frightening creature, known to many as The Thing in the Woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of Kislev. Left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again. \n\n# CONTENT OVERVIEW\n\n•\t1 Legendary Lord\n•\t1 Legendary Hero\n•\t1 Lord\n•\t1 Hero\n•\t5 Battle Units\n•\t3 Regiments of Renown\n•\tNew gameplay mechanics and features\n•\tPlayable in both Immortal Empires Realms of Chaos campaigns",
