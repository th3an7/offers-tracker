  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# The official sequel to the 1989 8-bit classic!\n<!--text-->\nNobody asked for it, yet the official sequel to the game “Baby Boomer” from Wisdom Tree is out 35 years after the original! This is literally breaking the world record for the longest time in-between video game sequels!\n\nYou heard us right “Baby Boomer 2: 35 Years Too Soon” is the official sequel to the 8-bit Wisdom Tree classic from 1989! If you don’t believe us, look it up!\n\nMade in collaboration with Piko Interactive and the right holder for the original game!\n\nNow, for such an incredible game you must be wondering what it is, well it’s an arcade shooter playable with 4 friends in local coop (Or alone... if you’re a looser like me) where you must protect Baby Boomer and get him safely to back to his mom! After all he’s been lost for more than 35 years!\n\nThis is going to sound way more easy than it actually is, Baby Boomer is actually a bit of a naughty boy, not because he wets his diapers (Which he does, don’t get me wrong) but because somehow everyone on earth is against him, he’s also kind of dumb so he’s going to go to hell by mistake, be ready to fights demons, skeletons and even walking chainsaws! This might be the most frustrating and challenging game you will ever play!\n\nThis sequel is more than an homage to the original, it’s actually a complete overall of every mechanics of the game! So if you were one of the 3 fans of the original be ready to get your mind blown! For everyone else, don’t worry you don’t need to play the original to enjoy the BEAUTY of this sequel! It’s so much better, I MEAN LOOK AT THE GRAPHICS! \n\nWhat are you waiting for, get this game! Get it right now! It’s the best sequel to a video game ever made, don’t believe me? Well that’s mean and I will tell your mom.\n\nOkay, thanks for reading my description, good bye!\n\nLove you ga ga goo goo\n\nxx\n\n-Baby Boomer\n",
