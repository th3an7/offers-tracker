In Hell let loose, it’s always better to tackle things as a team. If you think you can handle the chaos of war, we’ll see you on the frontlines!\n\n**Unique Meta Game**\n\nManage resources and supplies to call in support, bombing runs, new vehicles, strafing runs and to reinforce strong-points or flank enemies. When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n• Fight in epic 50 vs 50 multiplayer battles.\n\n• Two distinct gamemodes - Offensive and Warfare\n\n• 9 maps with more added frequently - land at Omaha Beach, fight through Carentan and into the frozen forests of Foy before climbing Hill 400.\n\n• Never fight the same battle twice - 99 capture point variations per map, means thousands of potential battles.\n\n• Play and master one or many of 14 unique roles, including:\n\nOfficer, Medic, Machinegunner, Commander, Crewman, Sniper and more.\n\n• Constantly updated with new maps, weapons, features and fixes.\n\n• True to life ballistics and recoil patterns create satisfying, skillful gunplay.\n\n• In-game proximity voip, command voip and unit voip.\n\n• Brutal combat - friend and foe are dismembered by heavy weapons.\n\n• Persistent player progression - show off your experience by unlocking new uniforms, loadouts and other customisation options as you level up each individual role, as well as your player.\n\n• Take control of a huge array of WW2 vehicles - including the Tiger, Sherman, Stuart, Puma and more - with additional vehicles still to come\n\n• Bombard and wipe the enemy from the field by taking control of heavy weapons - such as anti-tank guns and artillery.\n\n• Build defenses on the battlefield to fortify your position.\n\n• Use teamwork to smash through the enemy front line and push through to victory.\n\n• Play the game as the Commander and lead your team to victory using different abilities as you orchestrate your forces via the tactical map.\n",
