  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Thank You for Your Application\n<!--text-->\n*“Thank You for Your Application” is an interview simulation game. You play as a recent graduate who joins the Aeropolis Group as a recruitment officer. Your job is to screen applicants’ CVs and issue rejection letters with various reasons. As you try to pass your probation period, you start to question your job and the monotony of corporate life…*\n\n**Multiple story paths and endings**: Your first job is a pivotal choice that shapes your life.\n**Over a hundred candidates with diverse backgrounds**: Insulting the interviewer is strictly prohibited.\n**Wide range of online shopping choices after work**: Earn money in Aeropolis, spend it in Aeropolis – not a penny goes home.\n**Manage your personal life after hours**: Emotional stability is a must-have trait for outstanding employees.\n\n\n### The Recruitment Officer’s Job.\nReview resumes and documents of other candidates to make hire or reject decisions based on the daily hiring requirements.\n\nCheck their **internship certificates**, we want experienced graduates.\n\nCheck their **mental certificates**, we want mentally stable employees.\n\nCheck their **diplomas**, we want students from top universities, but we can't use their education as a reason to reject them.\n\n\n### The Recruitment Officer’s Dilemmas\nDon’t forget to pay the rent on time to avoid becoming an illegal resident without a place to live.\n\nRemember to maintain your own mental health; the company doesn’t want employees on the verge of collapse.\n\nWhen hiring turns into pretend hiring, when pretend hiring turns into layoffs, and when the layoffs spill over into themselves, where do the workers go from here?\n\n<!--image-->\n![Thank You For Your Application-1q1wx](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/ebb0e48796a64bb78cfbd7dd94fcbc3f/thank-you-for-your-application-1q1wx.jpg)\n",
