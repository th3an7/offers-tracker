  "longDescription": "<!--image-->\n![Calamity-1yrp1](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-1yrp1.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Welcome to Calamity, a free-to-play action-RPG set in a vibrant 2D top-down world.\n<!--text-->\nInspired by legendary games such as World of Warcraft, Lineage, Diablo, and Albion Online, Calamity offers a rich and engaging experience where you can conquer challenging dungeons or battle against other players.\nWith a variety of classes, skills, and foes, every player can find their unique path in this captivating fantasy world.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Calamity-vp35q](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-vp35q.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nA cornerstone of Calamity's design is our dedication to fostering a player-driven open economy, underpinned by principles of fairness and balance. We're stepping away from the all-too-common industry trends like microtransactions, pay-for-convenience, and pay-to-win schemes that undermine the value of in-game achievements. Our belief is that these practices detract from the true worth of items earned through dedication and skill.\nInstead, we're empowering our players by enhancing the value of gameplay-obtained items. In Calamity, every item can be traded on our marketplace using the in-game currency, which is backed by an on-chain token. This approach not only makes the gameplay more rewarding but also supports a vibrant economy within the game. The fees generated from marketplace transactions and other in-game activities will be redistributed to support both our token holders and the player community.\nOur monetization model is straightforward and player-friendly, focusing on premium monthly subscriptions and the sale of unique Artifacts. These Artifacts (also purchasable with our in-game token), play a key role in enriching the game's ecosystem and adding depth to the customization of player's experience.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Calamity-wlc4y](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-wlc4y.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nCalamity's combat embraces a classic target-based system, blending precision with strategy. Players will find a balance between single-target skills, which automatically apply to the chosen target, and a diverse array of area-of-effect (AOE) and directional skills that require careful aiming and tactical planning. The inclusion of various defensive and evasive maneuvers further enriches the combat experience, ensuring both accessibility for newcomers and depth for veterans.\nOur philosophy follows the timeless \"easy to learn, hard to master\" approach, inviting players to continuously develop and refine their combat skills.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Calamity-1ydr3](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-1ydr3.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nIn Calamity, we donâ€™t follow the traditional class system. There are no predefined classes. Instead, your role and abilities are defined by the Specializations tied to the weapons you wield.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Specializations:\n<!--text-->\nWarrior, Archer, and Mage represent our initial three specializations, with plans to introduce three additional ones in future updates. Each comes with its own unique weapons and corresponding skill sets:\nWarriors may choose between mighty two-handed swords and devastating two-handed axes.\nArchers have the precision of bows and the power of crossbows at their disposal.\nMages can channel their frost might through staffs or unleash fire with magic swords.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Weapon Skills:\n<!--text-->\nEach weapon carries up to four active Specialization-defining skills: two specialization base skills and two unique to the weapon type itself. This means axes and swords share a couple of skills but also boast two that are distinctly their own. Players can tailor their arsenal by rerolling skills on their weapons at a dedicated NPC for a nominal resource fee.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Armor Skills:\n<!--text-->\nDiversify your build further with plate, leather, and cloth armor, each offering its own set of active and passive skills. However, your choice of armor isn't restricted by your Specialization; warriors can equip plate or any other armor type as they see fit.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Calamity-s6yju](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-s6yju.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nCalamity features a variety of classic mechanics for character development and power growth, tailored to accommodate diverse playstyles:\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Leveling Up:\n<!--text-->\nProgress in Calamity is closely tied to your choice of weaponry. Using a specific weapon type in dungeons allows you to level up the corresponding Specialization, with each level enhancing your character's stats. Changing your weapon type switches your specialization level accordingly. You're free to swap Specializations without penalties within the City, encouraging experimentation and flexibility in your adventure.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Itemization:\n<!--text-->\nDive into dungeons of increasing difficulty to discover more powerful gear. Items come in four rarity levels: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic. The higher an item's rarity, the more stats it boasts. Items feature a mix of predefined stats and random attributes, adding layers of strategy and uniqueness to building your character's capabilities.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Gems System:\n<!--text-->\nAdopting a classic approach, Calamity lets you embed gems into your equipment, enhancing your gear with crucial stats. With five types of gems available, each offering unique bonuses for different equipment pieces, strategic gem placement is key. Enhance your gear further by crafting more potent gems through combination or extracting them for reuse.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Item Enhancement:\n<!--text-->\nBoost your gear's power by combining two similar items, enhancing one to new levels (from +1 up to +10). Enhancements up to +4 succeed without fail, but attempting higher levels introduces the risk of failure, which can reduce the enhancement level by one instead of increasing it. This system adds an element of risk and reward, challenging players to balance ambition with caution.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Calamity-mg5gw](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-mg5gw.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nIn Calamity, Artifacts aren't just any items; they're unique and rare treasures. They fit into a special slot for your character, enhancing their appearance with special effects like floating pets, auras, or wings. These Artifacts are rare finds, available only through select events, placing them among the most sought-after items in the game.\nBut Artifacts aren't all about looks. They also boost your gameplay, giving you extra experience points and higher chances of finding loot. You can earn Artifacts through special in-game challenges or exclusive events. Outside of the game Artifacts will be represented by NFTs. This way, Artifacts offer both a visual upgrade and a gameplay advantage, making them valuable assets on your adventure.\n\n<!--clickableImage-->\n[![Calamity-cp0mb](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/865b1a619fe744ed81dd0415fd50f5e6/calamity-cp0mb.png)](https://discord.gg/n3uBgxpTmE)\n",
