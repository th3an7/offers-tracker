  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Welcome to Mican! Explore hand crafted dungeons, fight tons of zany monsters, and discover the ancient truth behind the origin of monsters!\n<!--text-->\nExplore hand crafted dungeons, fight or befriend tons of zany monsters, and discover the ancient truth behind the origin of monsters!\n\nMonsters of Mican is a first person, party based dungeon crawler RPG, often known as a Blobber, with turn-based combat. The game was heavily inspired by classic PC RPGs such as Might and Magic and Wizardry, with plenty of modern flair and heaps of QOL features, and a heavy focus on variety (level variety, reward variety and enemy variety) and wild, silly and sometimes bizarre monster designs!\n\n \n**Game Features**\n\n\n- Over 275 monster types to fight, befriend, and even talk with!\n\n- Over 100 semi-randomized monster traits that greatly change how monsters behave in battle!\n\n- A highly robust character creator with 14 character classes to choose from!\n\n- Hundreds of abilities/spells, including one unique ability exclusive to each class!\n\n- Dozens of passive skills, with upgradeable level and rank!\n\n- Handcrafted dungeons designed with unique mechanics to tell a story environmentally, including three brand new dungeons released with the Vitreous Expansion and four more with the Crystal Expansion!\n\n- Hundreds of secrets hidden throughout the dungeons, offering unique and exciting rewards!\n\n- Dozens of NPCs with their own stories and personalities!\n\n- Thrilling boss battles!\n\n- A monster arena where you can watch any monsters you choose duke it out!\n\n- Diablo-like loot rewards, with fixed Artifact items as well as generated items grouped by rarity and enchantments!\n\n- Monster Buddies, a system that allows you to befriend monsters and then visit or summon them to fight for you!\n\n- 6 post-game challenge dungeons with specific themed rules and conditions!\n\n- Monster Rush Challenge: fight every monster in the game, sequentially!\n\n- Boss Rush Challenge: fight every boss in the game... ALL AT ONCE! \n\n- An original soundtrack featuring over 20 unique compositions made in the style of classic 90s CRPGs \n\n- A robust list of difficulty options and video settings \n\n- An in-game cheat vendor that will trade you powerful wands for various cheat codes \n\n- Full gamepad controls \n\n**Overview:**\n\nThe game takes place on Mican, a world turned upside down long ago by an event called \"The Amalgam Anomaly\" which birthed hundreds if not thousands of different types of monsters, creatures, half-breed amalgams and other nightmares into the world. The game has you create a party to venture into a mountain at the heart of Spiny Island to discover what the monsters in the caves are up to... and discover other mysterious secrets about the world in the process!\n\n\n\n**Expansion 2: Crystal Edition**\n\n\nSomething is stirring deep beneath the ground. \n\nA new pathway has opened up in the Unending Tower, leading to a brand new area known as the Mineral Realm! Learn about ancient Micani, fight tricky crystal monsters, avoid traps, solve puzzles and find your way through a nested maze to confront an old familiar name about the sins of his past, and what devastation the future may bring.\n\nMonsters of Mican: Crystal Edition brings forward this brand new post-game story with multiple dungeons, bosses, and an ending that lets you once again choose how the fate of all of reality is decided.\n\n\n\nOther Features:\n\n\n\nThe Warren- a new dungeon accessible just outside of Alright Outpost, \"hidden\" by a not-so-inconspicuous bush. Brave the deadly traps hidden by the Thieves Guild to earn yourself honorary membership, or perhaps instead help a darker force...\n\nFrank's Racetrack- what's cooler than a talking hot dog? A talking hot dog with sunglasses! What's cooler than a talking hot dog with sunglasses? A talking hot dog with sunglasses riding a skateboard! Race against Frankfurter The Fast in one of three difficulty levels to earn unique prizes and stat boosts that are all about speed and agility! Find the racetrack outside of the cafeteria in the Unearthed Halls Level 2!\n\nFishing-  Pick up the fishing rod lying around against a rock on the beach and get casting in any body of water, sewage or even lava! A new NPC named Herman the Crab Hermit will give you a quest to find all 12 types of fish in the world, but be warned that fishing too much in one spot can draw the attention of fearsome sea beasts....\n\nNearly 40 new monsters! From Gemignite to Carewolf to Challahback, enemy variety has never been better! Now there are nearly 300 monster types to fight, befriend, and chat with! And with 4 different Monster Buddy interactions for each monster that's... A lot of dialogue!\n\n\n\nSee the detailed patch notes for the rest of the changes!\n\n\n\n\n\n**Expansion 1: Vitreous Edition**\n\n\nThe Vitreous Expansion introduced three huge new dungeons: \n\nSpinewood Forest- home to the Fairy Queen Bryxialla, this dungeon teems with traps and creatures that want nothing more than to put you in the ground to fertilize the soil. Beware the many illusions and foggy spots in the forest, lest you lose your way...\n\nThe Pipeline- brave the stench as you trudge through toxic muck to receive the unique bounty offered by the denizens of the sewer. Prepare to go for a swim as you fight the mighty Dungen Master and proceed to Lord Muffin's lair...\n\nThe Butlery- a magically interconnected space meant for storing and processing food served to all inns throughout the world who belong to the Tavern Association. The inner workings of the Butlery though are not for the faint of heart, as you must brave four unique and discrete zones before gaining access to the most prized innkeeper's items within the Vault.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Monsters of Mican-1c1xv](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/2e7b063c93cf49caa47b0cd8daccaecb/monsters-of-mican-1c1xv.png)\n",
