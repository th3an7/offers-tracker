  "longDescription": "<p>System that make use of tags to keep track of things that happen during gameplay in order to be used at a later stage from other systems.</p><p>The system has endless use cases, i will just mention a few to give an idea of what it is:</p><ul><li>Quest systems.</li><li>Story progression.</li><li>Characters short and long term memory.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Let&#39;s say that a particular quest need a door to be opened, a specific item to be picked up in the world and specific dialogue line to be triggered in order to be completed.</p><p><br /></p><p>In a normal scenario you would have to retrieve the door actor to check if it was opened, maybe check in the inventory if the item has been picked up and need a very specific way to store the FACT that a specific dialogue line has been triggered, this however has a few potential issues:</p><ul><li>Maybe the door has been unloaded or is in another level, it&#39;s not in the world anymore and you can&#39;t check if it is open.</li><li>The quest need an item to be picked up, but it does not care if you actually have it in an inventory so you can&#39;t rely on checking the inventory item quantity.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>A solution would be to store a boolean for each of these FACTS which is fine, game facts work the same way, instead of storing boolean store gameplay tags with an associated integer for more flexibility.</p><p>Following up on the above example, the plugin could do something like this:</p><ul><li>Add a game facts component to the game state, game instance or whatever, somewhere global that we know is always loaded.</li><li>When the door is opened add the fact to the game state.</li><li>When the item is picked up add the fact to the game state.</li><li>When the specific dialogue line is triggered add the fact to the game state.</li><li>Once the quest need a resolution, simply retrieve the facts stored in the game state and proceed however you want.</li></ul>",
