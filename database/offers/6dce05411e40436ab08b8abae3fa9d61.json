  "description": "Enjoy the ultimate adventure in the Best RPG of 2021 with all six premium expansions. Lead a band of unique companions, forge alliances, and rise as a Mythic Hero to decide the fate of mortals and gods alike.",
  "longDescription": "The Game of the Year Edition includes Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous with all six premium expansions and four free DLCs available after the game's original release. Enjoy the complete experience throughout over 150 hours of gameplay! Lead the Fifth Crusade to free the lands of demon hordes. Diversify your playthrough by choosing from 10 mythic paths, 25 classes, and 160 archetypes. Build friendships and romantic relationships with 12 companions, but remember that your decisions affect how they feel about you.\n\nWhat will you gain along the way? Mythic powers and incredible might? Friends and lovers? Or will you side with evil, turning everyone in your path into enemies… or into just another dish on your menu? It's all up to you!\n\nRevel in the peak of your power and learn more about the mysterious Aeons as you explore the Axis with the Inevitable Excess DLC!\n\nSee history through the eyes of the ordinary citizens of Kenabres as you help them survive in the burning city overrun by demons in the Through the Ashes DLC.\n\nExperiment with builds and practice your combat skills in roguelike mode as you travel the islands in The Treasure of the Midnight Isles DLC.\n\nMeet your new companion, Ulbrig Olesk. Empowered with the ability to transform into a mighty griffin, he can be a steadfast fighter in your party, a trusted friend — and maybe even something more. Embark on a journey to places dear to his heart, fight unique enemies, and uncover the secrets of your loyal companion's past in The Last Sarkorians DLC!\n\nYour characters from the Through the Ashes expansion have been through a lot and are ready to face far more dangerous adversaries — let them influence history with The Lord of Nothing DLC.\n\nReturn to the rebuilt Kenabres to celebrate your glorious victory, enjoy time with your friends and loved ones, and uncover the city’s last sinister secret in the A Dance of Masks DLC!",
