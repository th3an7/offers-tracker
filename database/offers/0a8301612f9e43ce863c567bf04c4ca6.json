  "longDescription": "# THE CHANGELING \n\nI make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. In the shadows, I bide my time. \n\nThis pack introduces the Changeling, a new Legendary Lord for Tzeentch, usable in both Realms of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns, as well as new units, characters, and regiments of renown.\n\n​​• Enact malign schemes and trickery with the Changeling of Tzeentch. \n​​• Scatter magical spells far and wide with the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch; a new Legendary Hero. \n​​• ​Expand your roster with 5 additional  units, and enhance your troops with 3 new Regiments of Renown, including the Chaos Lord of Tzeentch, Tzaangors, Changebringers, and the Mutalith Vortex Beast.\n\nAs the shape-shifting agent of misrule, the Changeling embodies the Changer of Ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. Able to take the form of any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, none, save perhaps Tzeentch himself, know the Changeling's true form. His trickery may even deceive the Dark Gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork. \n\nThe perplexing prankster of the known world, the Changeling of Tzeentch, was here. \n\nAs a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the Lore of Tzeentch, the Changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. When not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike. \n\nTrust no one.\n\n# SCHEMES AND TRICKERY \n\nThe Changeling’s inscrutable and deceiving nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. For the Changeling, the world is divided into Theatres; segmented regions that contain Schemes, both minor and pivotal. Fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a Theatre down through smaller, cheekier Schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a Grand Scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way. \n\nGold, Grimoires, and Rifts aplenty.  \n\nWith enough Grand Schemes carried out, the Changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the Ultimate Scheme for campaign victory. \n\n# THE BLUE SCRIBES \n\nThis troublesome Legendary Hero, the Blue Scribes, ride atop their Disc of Tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. If only they knew what those words meant... \n\n# CONTENT OVERVIEW\n•\t1 Legendary Lord\n•\t1 Legendary Hero\n•\t1 Lord\n•\t1 Hero\n•\t5 Battle Units\n•\t3 Regiments of Renown\n•\tNew gameplay mechanics and features\n•\tPlayable in both Immortal Empires Realms of Chaos campaigns",
