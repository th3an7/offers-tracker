  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# “Djinn - The Forbidden Knowledge” is a thrilling open-world horror adventure with a retro twist...\n<!--text-->\nImmerse yourself in this unique story as an Arabian Princess and confront your enemies in a desperate fight for survival. This is no ordinary realm, but a twisted reflection of your own trauma. To survive, you must unveil the dark secrets that lurk within, but can you conquer your own demons?\n\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- Exploring a unique open-world hiding many secrets\n- Captivating and mysterious story with 13 endings\n- Various challenges and enemy types to deal with\n- Haunting adventure with a playtime of 8 - 12 hours\n- Not hand-holding and old school style gameplay\n- Integrated easter eggs referencing works of horror\n\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nDjinn is an exploration-focused game that also incorporates action, platforming, and light puzzles. Despite its challenging old-school style with roguelite elements, it doesn't punish you by making you lose the inventory items upon death, allowing for steady progression. It's crucial to collect notes that unveil the story, lore, and environment's secrets as you explore and face off against various enemies and even some bosses. Resource management is also key, as you'll need to find and strategically use items to maintain your health, stamina, and sanity as you immerse further into this adventure.\n\n\n**Prologue**\n\nOman's 19th-century golden age, crossroads of trading routes, began to crumble under the weight of a new and terrifying threat. The once vibrant markets fell silent, replaced by a chilling emptiness and whispers. By 1840, with malevolent forces rising from the darkness and magicians weaving their deceptive schemes, the Sultan was forced to abandon his homeland. He relocated his capital to Zanzibar in Africa, leaving the Sultanate to face a future shrouded in fear and uncertainty.\n\n\n**Mission**\n\nExperience the unsettling story as you progress through the realm of the unknown, wielding your weapons against creatures from this world and beyond. Learn how to survive in an ever-changing environment, where the very land itself can be your enemy and every shadow hides a threat. Define your own path – explore and scavenge for resources to overcome the trials.\n\n\n**Endings**\n\n“Djinn - The Forbidden Knowledge” offers multiple endings, each open to your interpretation and imagination. If you pay close attention to detail as the story unfolds, you will discover new answers and unlock a more profound understanding of the narrative.\n\n\n**Options**\n\nThe game features a range of settings (see Screenshot) to customize your experience for both quality and performance. However, some of the settings change dynamically to increase your immersion and simulate your psychological and physical state, such as: FOV (80°- 90°), Camera Shake, DOF, Vignettes and Sound Levels (SFX and Music).\n\n<!--image-->\n![Djinn - The Forbidden Knowledge-r2687](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/6c67b9f26a5d4c0ea4ab6374575a84f4/djinn--the-forbidden-knowledge-r2687.png)\n",
