  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe Deluxe Edition includes one copy of **The Inquisitor game**, the **digital compendium**, the **original soundtrack**, and the awe-inspiring **Grandmaster's Attire**. Get ready to fulfill your inquisitorial duties to the Holy Office in style and strike fear into the hearts of all sinners within Koenigstein’s borders.\n\nThe Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church.\n\nYou are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury**\n<!--text-->\nYour role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law?\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **A morally tainted, non-linear tale**\n<!--text-->\nThis is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Enlightened sleuthing**\n<!--text-->\nMordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Delve into the Unworld**\n<!--text-->\nUnbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Persuasive interrogations**\n<!--text-->\nThe 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Let your sword do the talking**\n<!--text-->\nSometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.\n",
