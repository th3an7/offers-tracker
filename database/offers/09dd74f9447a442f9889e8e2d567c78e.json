  "title": "Pulse Physiology Engine",
  "description": "The Pulse Physiology Engine is an open source library for accurate, consistent, dynamic simulation of the whole-body response to injury, disease, and treatment.",
  "longDescription": "<p>The Pulse Physiology Engine can be used as a standalone library or integrated with simulators, sensor interfaces, and models of all fidelities. The platform includes a common data model for standard model and data definitions, a software interface for engine control, robust physics-based circuit and transport solvers, and a verification and validation suite. The architecture was specifically designed to reduce model development time and increase the usability of the engine in simulations by creating a modular, extensible definition for human physiology. Pulse provides the following benefits to its user community:</p><ul><li><strong>Sound underlying physics:</strong> Clear, accurate, precise first principles conservation equations</li><li><strong>Standardized data model:</strong> Easily understandable, widely usable, ontologies and software interfaces</li><li><strong>Extensible:</strong> Reusable, repeatable implementation to allow the addition of new capabilities and functionality</li><li><strong>Modular:</strong> Interdependent, hierarchical models for varying fidelity and complexity</li><li><strong>Thorough documentation:</strong> In-depth, referenced descriptions of physiology methodology and software design</li><li><strong>Cross-platform deployment:</strong> Easy compilation on all standard operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, and ARM) and multiple languages (C&#43;&#43;, C#, Java, Python)</li><li><strong>Credible:</strong> Computational models transparently derived from evidence-based literature and analyzed with extensive verification and validation tools</li><li><strong>Open:</strong> Public repository managed by experienced Kitware team with a permissible Apache 2.0 license for multicenter and multidisciplinary collaborative development</li></ul><p>Pulse is comprised of numerical models representing the different body systems, feedback mechanisms and interactions between the systems, PK/PD, and medical equipment. The major systems are modeled using zero-dimensional lumped-parameter circuit analogs (e.g., the cardiovascular circuit) with homeostatic feedback. The differential equations contained in each system are calculated through transient analysis with a shared dynamic time step. The numerical models currently execute with a time step of 20 ms, which can be reduced, as necessary, to ensure all physiology features of interest are captured, while maintaining real-time execution for the simulation.</p>",
