  "title": "Modding Tool - Geo-Political Simulator 5",
  "description": "With the Geo-political Simulator 5 Modding Tool add-on, you can create your own game scenarios (mods), share them with other players and play all shared mods.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# The modding tool add-on lets players create and play contexts and scenarios (mods), as well as share them with other users.\n<!--text-->\n**A comprehensive creation tool**\n   \n### The modding add-on lets you:\n\n- modify country data (economic, political, demographic, fiscal...) or a company (name, group structure, financial results, workforce, capital...)\n- change international relations between countries (diplomatic alignment, military alliances...) \n- transform world geography (merging countries, making regions independent, putting a new city on the map, adding or removing buildings of all kinds...)\n- create highly detailed and advanced missions and scenarios using scripts (triggering protests, wars, disasters, political scandals, assassinations, national elections, character demands... with the option of defining several conditions for triggering these events, and editing game text...) \n- remake history by creating scenarios starting in the past or the future, from year 1900 \n- enrich the scenarios with new character faces and names, new logos and group names with the customization kit that can be used with the modding tool \n- easily share your creations (host and download from our website, directly send mods from the game...) \n- add images and videos from your computer that can appear during the scenario (breaking news on television, news headlines...)\n\n\n\n### Some examples\n  \n**    • Make America Greater! **\n      In January 2025, as the President of the United States, your goal is to annex Greenland, Canada, and Panama. Amid complex negotiations, international rivalries, and local resistance, every decision will shape the global balance of power. Strategy, diplomacy, and boldness will be essential to strengthen American influence and build a stronger America than ever before.\n      \n**    • Arctic Wars **\n      In 2026, the United States and Russia vie for control of the immense resources of the Arctic which, because of climate change, have become more easily accessible. After the election of a Republican president in the 2016 election, the United States has established additional military bases on the west coast of Greenland. Russia has done the same on the east coast of Greenland. Petroleum (10% of the world's reverse), gas, aluminum, rare earth elements...this part of the world has become strategically crucial and considering the antagonistic nature of the presidents of these two superpowers, the risk of conflagration is extremely high! Moreover, a worried Greenland wants independence from its controlling nation, the Kingdom of Denmark, and the restrictive laws of its environmental program. It's up to you: as the leader of Denmark, try to avoid global unrest!\n      \n**    • The End of Europe?**\n      In the year 2028, the European Union has completely broken apart. Nearly all of its countries have left the organization after populist parties win national elections. Moreover, several states were created after some regions (such as Catalonia and Scotland) gained their independence. Take charge of the opposition party of various countries to try to build a new Europe.\n",
