  "description": "The spriggan known as Van Arkride, an underground professional, accepts any job, acting as detective, negotiator, or bounty hunter. Dive into the Trails series' latest chapter with intense combat, beautiful visuals, and a new alignment system in Calvard!",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n*-1 Campaign offers and durations vary across platforms.                                \n-2 If you purchased the game or the relevant bundle before this promo, the contents will also been automatically added to your library.*\n\nAfter the war, Calvard is enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity. However, the public grows uncertain as the number of immigrants increases and political reform runs rampant. Follow Van, a young man and local spriggan, on a unique request that will prove more than he bargained for. Will the nation fall into chaos? \n\nThe AT (Action Time) battle command has been completely revamped transitioning seamlessly from field battles to turn-based combat. The sixth-generation tactical orbment Xipha offers a revolutionary combat experience unique to this iteration of the Trails series!\n\nIn addition, the Topic System allows players to gain an advantage in battle by using conversation topics as bargaining chips. These topics can be obtained by interacting with other characters throughout the city. The game also features the Alignment system, which allows players to change their character’s three unique attributes and influence characteristics such as their status, the forces they fight with (or against), and even how the plot unfolds.\n\nDive into the dynamic adventure in \"Trails through Daybreak!\"\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# About\n<!--text-->\nThe spriggan's life is but one of many professions that has emerged from the Calvard Republic. Be it playing detective, negotiator, or bounty hunter, Van Arkride takes on the kind of work that can't be taken to more legitimate sources. It could be something the police can't handle, work that's best left out of the public eye, or even a request from a criminal of organization in the underworld; so long as it pays and doesn't cross too far over the gray line, he'll accept near-any job that comes across his table.\n\nThe year is 1208. A prim-and-proper young lady dressed in the uniform of an esteemed academy visits a dilapidated, multi-tenant building in a downtown district of Edith, the nation's capital. With a most dignified gaze, she looks upon the plague of the door before her. It reads: 'ARKRIDE Solutions Office: Complicated Matters Only.'\n\nSteeling herself, she knocks on the door three times.\n\n\"First thing in the morning...?\" a relaxed yet surprisingly young voice grumbles with a yawn.\n\nFrom the moment he opens the door to greet her, a new tale begins.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Key Features\n<!--text-->\nThe AT (Action Time) Battle system has been completely revamped, transitioning seamlessly from field battles to turn-based combat.\n\nThe sixth-generation combat orbment, Xipha, offers a revolutionary combat experience unique to this iteration of the Trails series!\n\nIn addition, the Topic system allows players to gain an advantage in battle by using conversation topics as bargaining chips.
