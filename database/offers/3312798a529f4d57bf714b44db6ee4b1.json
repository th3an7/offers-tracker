  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Who Can you Trust?\n<!--text-->\nDive into the heart-pounding depths of Mimic, an intense online multiplayer survival horror experience set aboard the doomed spaceship, the Icarus. With 5 players in matchmaking and up to 8 in private lobbies, collaboration is key as you and your fellow survivors strive to flee the clutches of impending doom.\n\nBeware the insidious presence of the Mimic, an alien entity masquerading as one of your own. As tension mounts, the ship hurtles toward destruction on a collision course with the sun, while relentless killer maintenance droids prowl the corridors, seeking to eradicate any trace of the alien threat.\n\nIn a game of strategic deceit, players wield the power to influence the android's pursuit, sabotage escape efforts, and sow chaos amongst the ranks. Trust becomes a scarce commodity as you discern friend from foe amidst the mayhem.\n\nAs part of the crew, your objective is clear: repair the escape shuttle and flee the crumbling vessel. But unlocking security access and evading the murderous androids prove formidable obstacles on the path to salvation. Success hinges on identifying and expelling the Mimic from your midst before it's too late.\n\nYet, lurking among your ranks is a corporate agent, operating covertly to fulfill their own clandestine agenda. With hidden objectives and a sinister mandate, their presence adds a layer of intrigue and betrayal to an already precarious situation.\n\nUnveil the true nature of the Mimic as it reveals itself to feed and perpetuate its existence. With survival as the ultimate prize, will you trust your instincts or succumb to the darkness that threatens to consume you all?\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Player Roles\n<!--text-->\n**The Crew**\nAs part of the crew, your objective is clear: repair the escape shuttle and flee the crumbling vessel.
