  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Become a Showstopper of SaGa legend in Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama\n<!--text-->\nIn a universe where a single level up choice can change everything, the SaGa: Emerald Beyond characters stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vampire Survivors, united to face their next adventure together. Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire? We doubt it, but never say never. \n\nAs the Junction opens, the Vampire Survivors are thrust into a strange system of interconnected worlds, from a wondrous enchanted witchdom to a sinister realm of bloody nightmares. Equipped with the power of Glimmers and befriended by those that understand this strange universe better than anyone, onward they step in to the unknown; united in cause, wanting to survive, and bereft of fear. Well maybe a little bit of fear. \n\n12+ New Characters \nAn eclectic cast of bizarre SaGa protagonists join the Survivors, including: \nTsunanori Mido - A fate-forged master of Kugutsu combat puppets. \nAmeya Aisling - An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats) \nBonnie & Formina - A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms. \nDiva No.5 - A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds (and robotic bodies) to rediscover her memories. \nAnd Many More! - including a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies... \n\n16+ New Weapons & the Glimmer mechanic \n40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the SaGa series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there's a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of SaGa gets represented! \nFleuret - stab enough encroaching enemies and you'll Glimmer the Crystalline Carve, letting you freeze foes whilst cutting them down.  \nPressure Point - unleash a barrage of martial arts blows at close range to Glimmer the far-reaching fire jab Shenlong Firefist. \nHecaton Machine Gun - shoot a blistering salvo of interestingly inaccurate bullets to Glimmer the Bombarding Fire technique, blasting baddies with a massive upheaval of the earth.  \nHyperion Bazooka - master these high-power missiles that explode as they penetrate through hordes of foes to Glimmer the Cosmic Rave to massively multiply your firepower.  \n\nCharacter parties \nNo JRPG DLC is complete without a squad of odd allies to pal around with. Level up Tsunanori Mido to summon up to 4 Kugutsu combat puppets, fighting independently with their own weapons in a defensive cross formation. Pick either Bonnie or Formina to play as both intrepid investigators, combining punches and pistols for a powerful partnership. And in the darkness of Yomi, rumours swirl of a Dismal King who can enthral defeated foes to make his own army of allies... \n\nShowstopper \nSurvivors never give up! When a SaGa character reaches critical HP they fight back from the brink with a Showstopper, a brief burst of bonus Might, decreased Cooldown, and a little extra Luck to help them survive whatever precarious situation you’ve put them in with a tempest of powered-up projectiles.    \n\nA New World-Weaving Stage \nFollow the Emerald Wave through a diorama of interwoven worlds, the perfect setting to walk sideways while mowing down masses of unusual monsters and bonkers bosses.  \n\nRemixes of Stupendous SaGa: Emerald Beyond Tracks  \n🎵A Fierce Engagement \n🎵A Quick Warm-Up \n🎵Against All Odds \n🎵CCPD, Moving Out! \n🎵Darkness Incarnate \n🎵Emerald Destinies  \n🎵Feel The Beat  \n🎵The World's Heartbeat \n🎵Yumeha, Chipper As Ever!\n",
