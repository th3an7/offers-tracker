  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.geopipe.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geopipe</a> offers digital twins of the real world. These models have been generated from real world data with the help of machine learning to produce high quality semantically labeled 3D Models. Our models include real world features including trees, roads, sidewalks in addition to the terrain and buildings. Additional features are like city benches, subway stations, street lights, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>Utilizing the <a href=\"https://www.geopipe.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geopipe</a> portal you can select locations in various cities around the world. You can then incorporate the models and semantic labels into your application, game, or experience.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.geopipe.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geopipe</a> supports multiple 3D formats including FBX and GLTF files so you can choose which format works best for your workflow without getting locked into a proprietary ecosystem.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.geopipe.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geopipe</a> supports streaming your area of interest right into Unreal Engine using the <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/cesium-for-unreal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cesium for Unreal</a> plugin.</p><p><br /></p><p>For additional information regarding model import, streaming, metadata, and more visit our <a href=\"https://docs.geopipe.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geopipe Developer Portal</a>.</p>",

  "technicalDetails": "<p>At download time, you can select to download your model in either an FBX or GLTF/GLB format. Models can be configured to include any permutation of terrain, buildings, and street-level objects.</p><p><br /></p><p>Models ship with PBR facade materials at resolutions up to 2K depending on the model fidelity. Terrain textures are 2K at the highest level of fidelity and 4K at lower levels. This is due to the lower levels of fidelity using geographically larger areas. All other textures are no larger than 2K and are fixed at all levels of detail. You are encouraged to replace the included textures to fit your stylistic needs.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our models can be optimized for either gaming and custom experiences or optimized for offline rendering. When optimized for gaming and editable experiences, individual buildings and objects can be deleted, edited, or moved to suit your needs. When optimized for rendering, individual meshes with the same material are grouped into a single larger mesh for a much smaller overall file size.</p><p><br /></p><p>When optimized for custom experiences, our windowed facades contain a secondary UV map with information related to the number of rows and columns on the facade and a unique per-facade ID. Colliders can be generated at import-time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Models can be downloaded at multiple quality levels and can be configured to not include textures.</p><p><br /></p><p>Very large models have the potential to have significant impacts on performance. This can be alleviated by adjusting the tiling parameter for your download. Your models can also be streamed into your application using <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/cesium-for-unreal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cesium for Unreal</a>.</p>",
