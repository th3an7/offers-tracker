  "longDescription": "# MASTER THE MACHINE\n\nConquer American mountains as you haul incredible tonnage with the workhorses of industry, get the British capital’s commuters to work in record time and race state-to-state aboard German high-speed traction. Play your own way with creative tools. Master the machine with Train Sim World 3: Standard Edition.\n\n# RAW POWER\n\nHaul hundreds of containers through California deserts and mountains with the ES44C4, a 4400-horsepower beast dressed in bold BNSF livery. Experience the thrill of 280 km/h in the ICE 1, Germany’s first true high-speed train, as you cut through the Hesse and Bavaria countryside. Combine precision and versatility with the Class 395 ‘Javelin’, Britain’s fastest train running passengers to and from London at 140mph. \n\n# EXTREME WEATHER\n\nNew volumetric skies bring a transformed atmosphere to routes, clouds roam free at altitude, casting shadows on the ground. Lightning dances among intense storms, the roar of thunder competing with the hefty sound of machinery. Feel total immersion as the turbulence of wind physics hammers the side of your train. Learn the art of defensive driving and remain in control.\n\n# YOUR HOBBY\n\nWith multiple trains per route, there is no end to the experiences on offer, and you can expand that further by creating your own journey with Scenario Planner and Livery Designer.
