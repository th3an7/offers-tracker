  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Xiao Bao opened his eyes, he was surrounded by six women. He embarked on an immersive journey of love with them.\n<!--text-->\n\"MY DESTINY GIRLS\" is an exciting dating simulation game that offers a unique and immersive experience through real-time interactive video. As soon as you wake up, you are surrounded by six beautiful girls, all showing their fondness for you in different ways. \n\nWith varying personalities ranging from sweet and kind to stubborn and controlling, it's up to you to navigate your way through their preferences and provide the happiness they deserve. \n\nCan you prove to them that love conquers all, regardless of material possessions, and become the one they've been waiting for? Give it a try and see if you have what it takes to capture the hearts of these beautiful girls!\n\n\nWho will you choose to be your partner at the end of your sweet journey?\n\nThe Cute & Cool roommate?\n\nThe Charming & Hot woman?\n\nThe Sweet& Innocent girl next door?\n\nOR\n\nThe Elegant & Sensual first crush?\n\nThe Gentle & Sexy doctor?\n\nThe Gorgeous & Wealthy lady?\n\nThere is always a suitable one for you.\n\nIs it possible that you genuinely like all of them?  You know what they say, \"the more, the merrier\" and \"good girls love to be chased.\" So why not just spread the love around? \n\nWhy limit yourself to just one? Only kids make choices, adults can have it all!\n\nAbout Us\n\nClassmate, who is your idol?\n\n\"Of course it's Xiaobao Wei! He came from a lowly background, but with his incredible luck, he rose to the top. And even at the peak of his life, he chose to retire and live a peaceful life with his seven wives.\" - This was the response from the little D, who claimed to be sick during college military training and spent the time reading all of Jin Yong's novels.\n\nYears later, the old D finally realized that ordinary people don't have any \"cheats\" in life. His interactions with characters from novels were limited to their backgrounds. The girl he had a crush on in high school ended up with a bad boy. The campus beauty queen in college chose his muscular athlete roommate. His colleague invited him over for dinner at the house of the girl he had a secret crush on. On Christmas, he confessed his feelings to a gorgeous girl only to find out she was his friend's ex-wife. When a lovely designer from Taiwan had to go back to her hometown, all he could afford was to take her to McDonald's (but it was the best McDonald's ever).\n\nIf he could turn back time, he would love to tell his younger self that we only live once.\n\nSince there is no time machine in reality, can we build one, the kind that allows us to cheat?\n\n\n\nThe old D shared this idea with his greasy friends B and G from the film and television industry over a few shots of strong liquor. With tears in his eyes, they all agreed to make it happen. B bluntly stated that after all these years, they should do something serious.\n\n\n\nWe dug into our own pockets to make this dream a reality and rallied our friends to help. What if we don't have the funds to hire big name celebrities? Well, we turned to our dreams. With our dreams, we were able to secure the friendly appearance of a popular young actress from Taiwan. With our dreams, we were able to convince a team of male producers who were tired of making period dramas to join our project. And with our dreams, we brought on a well-known Chinese music label, Seed Music(Zhongzi Music), to handle all the music production.\n\n\n\nOur only goal in doing all of this is to recapture the hormone-fueled excitement of youth - to capture the perfect shots of romantic pursuits, to make the process of falling in love sweet and fulfilling, and to give everyone hope in the beauty of love.\n\n\n\nGames can be restarted, but we only live once. Past regrets can be redeemed here, but what truly belongs to you is only the present. Be brave and love, Xiao Bao.\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\nLast year, the main creator of an annual drama has always been calm, but on the set, he was full of excitement and high energy. I'm glad I don't have to go home for a month. This has to be anonymous.\n\nOf course, 50 yuan a night is impossible to pull, Xiao Bao still has a bottom line, the final transaction price is 80.\n\nSomeone tried to be a casting director several times with his money.\n\nThe editor secretly replaced the C bit with his favorite when editing, and succeeded in half.\n\nThe test student on the opposite side said that in order to maximize the guarantee of quality, we must run at least 30 times.\n\nWe have 18 endings, and if we want to wear the crown, we must bear the weight, and it is not easy to get all of them.\n\nSeeing is better than hearing a hundred times, and we will provide a free trial version before the official release.\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFollow us to get the latest updates on \"MY DESTINY GIRLS\"\n\ntelegram: https://t.me/mydestinygirls\n\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mydestinygirls/\n\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mydesitnygirls/\n\nYouTube：https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCugQEmWVj0V6W_2uuRL1atA\n\n Business cooperation \n\nFor live streaming, please contact:cs@scascendtrend.com\n\nQQ：909383167（Add friends Please note: business negotiation）\n",
