  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# A CITY UNDER SIEGE\n<!--text-->\nFight your way through 9 new missions in the Urban Onslaught campaign to defend the great city of Mahanagar.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nA ferocious Arachnid onslaught has swept through the city’s suburbs, completely overwhelming local police forces. Never before did they face such a massive and meticulously orchestrated assault. Majestic boulevards and towering skyscrapers are reduced to rubble as the Bug hordes encroach upon the central districts. The very homes of our citizens are now in grave peril…\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# PROTECT & SERVE\n<!--text-->\n- Police Squad\nEach Police Squad operates a pair of detainer drones, designed to take down crime suspects - or distract the attention of Arachnids.\n- Riot Shield Squad\nTheir big shields and heavy armor are designed to resist enemy attacks and their grenade launchers can whittle down even the biggest enemies.\n- Peacekeeper Biped\nThis command vehicle can call in reinforcements, boost the damage output of friendly units and provide indirect fire support with its dual grenade launchers.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# MILITARY MIGHT\n<!--text-->\nThe current Arachnid incursion, however, calls for a much stronger response. The Mobile Infantry has arrived to preserve freedom and smash the Bugs! They’ve brought the latest war machines to quell even the most vicious Arachnid threats.\n\n- J.A.C. Trooper\nThe \"Jumpjet Assault Cannon\" Trooper carries a large recoilless rifle to smash through medium armor and a jetpack to take them to the high ground - or to get out of trouble.\n- M7 Cyclone\nThis highly mobile weapon platform can fire on the move to deal with both ground and air targets, and a booster jump ability to reach advantageous positions.\n- M23 Rainmaker\nWhen you need an endless storm of missiles to rain down upon your enemy, deploy the Rainmaker. This mobile missile launcher excels at providing long range fire support.\n- A-12 Pegasus Gunship\nTake control of the skies with the Pegasus Gunship. Its powerful minigun and wing-mounted rocket pods are ideal for ground support missions.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# HOLD THE LINE\n<!--text-->\nTo stem the tide, a whole new set of defensive turrets is available for deployment. No matter what the Arachnids throw at our positions, we have a combination of turrets ready to throw them back.\n\n- Autocannon Turret\nThis sturdy turret can take a lot of punishment, and its dual autocannons are effective against medium armored enemies but tend to overheat quickly.\n- Mortar Turret\nThis turret fires a barrage of mortar rounds to counter large hordes of lightly armored enemies.\n- Heavy Gun Turret\nThis weapon mounts a high velocity gun designed to take on heavily armored targets.\n- Ballistic Missile Turret\nWhen your defenses are under long range bombardment, deploy these turrets. Its heat seeking missiles can take down enemies from a great distance.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# KNOW YOUR ENEMY\n<!--text-->\nFederal Intelligence has reported the presence of several new Bug types rampaging through the ruins of Mahanagar. A good M.I. commander comes prepared to deal with these new threats.\n\n- Burster\nBursters eject a volatile substance that combusts after a short time delay. The dorsal glands that produce this substance also tend to explode upon the creature’s death.\n- Hornets\nThese flying Arachnids lack significant destructive firepower, but the real menace lies in their nests, which incessantly churn out a relentless swarm of Hornets.\n- Hornet Tanker\nThe Hornet Tanker carries Hornet nests on its back. Reaching and neutralizing this monstrosity, while managing the endless stream of Hornets, requires a careful approach.\n- Ravager\nThis Arachnid is a formidable foe capable of launching explosive projectiles. When it loses its tail from battle damage, it will charge in with its massive pincers.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# CONTENT SUMMARY:\n<!--text-->\nThis expansion includes:\n- A new richly detailed urban environment: Squash the Bugs in city streets, liberate a massive airport, clear internal buildings and venture through underground basements, sewers and metro lines.\n- 9 mission story campaign, focused on open maps that offer tactical freedom\n- 8 new player units, including mechanized missile launchers, hovering autocannons and airborne gunships\n- 4 new defensive turret types\n- 4 new Arachnid unit types\n",
