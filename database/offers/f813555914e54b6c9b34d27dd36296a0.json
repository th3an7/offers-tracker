  "description": "Fix directional movement inputs and add custom directional movement curves!",
  "longDescription": "<p>Are you working on a project where a player can move? Then this asset pack is for you! These macros not only fix an inherent &#34;flaw&#34; in movement inputs, but they also allow you to implement custom directional movement curves that naturally replicate and work on both controller and keyboard. The controller versions allow for partial-pressure inputs.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Regarding UE 4 &amp; Earlier</strong>: Movement seems to have changed DRASTICALLY with the introduction of UE 5 and Enhanced Input. I tried for a while to get these equations working within UE 4, with some success, but learned something interesting in doing so: The input graphs don&#39;t match. I have some working in 4, but not all. So if you need anything for 4, ask first and if it&#39;s one of the solutions I have I shall happily provide it.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Future of this product</strong>: I am absolutely fascinated by human motion and I have a background in astrophysics. I will likely make this asset part of a larger adaptive motion system. No ETA on that, but it&#39;s the long-term intent.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>VIDEO DEMO/INSTRUCTIONS</strong>: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/I0J30_WGO3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube Video</a></p><p><strong>Discord</strong>: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/dephoro\" rel=\"nofollow\">[dephoro] Discord</a> (Helpful Channels &amp; People)</p><p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://dephoro.com/help-center/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[dephoro] Help Center</a> (Forums &amp; Help Tickets)</p><p><br /></p><p>This product contains an elegant fix for the movement input system, while also allowing you to implement any custom directional movement curve of your choosing. Here&#39;s what you get with this pack (DSM stands for Directional Speed Modifier, abbreviated for ease of use):</p><p>1x &#34;DSM - Keyboard - Circularization&#34; Macro</p><p>1x &#34;DSM - Controller - Circularization&#34; Macro</p><p>1x &#34;DSM - Keyboard - Cosine&#34; Macro</p><p>1x &#34;DSM - Controller - Cosine&#34; Macro</p><p>1x &#34;True Speed Calculation - Cosine&#34; Macro</p><p><br /></p><p>Here is what each product does:</p><p><strong>&#34;Directional Speed Modifier - Circularization&#34; Macro</strong></p><p>THIS ONE IS A MUST-HAVE AND NO THAT&#39;S NOT A SALES GIMMICK. It fixes an inherent &#34;flaw&#34; in the movement input system WITHOUT affecting anything beyond that fix. The rest of your in-place and already-built movement systems SHOULD be completely unaffected. What this input does is perfectly circularize all combinations of X&#43;Y movement inputs. At all input angles. And it is impressively light-weight and should fully replicate in multiplayer games because of how the problem was addressed.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>&#34;Directional Speed Modifier - Cosine&#34; Macro</strong></p><p>This macro, instead of circularizing inputs to where a character has a steady speed in all directions, modifies directional movement along a (custom) cosine wave. When you move forward you move at full speed. When you move left or right you are moving at about 90% speed. When you move backwards, you are moving at about 70% speed. And the in-between values are a smooth gradient between those named values. This specific macro is what we, personally, use to somewhat mimic human directional movement; however, the point of our including it was so you can have a framework to make your own custom movement curves! Maybe your players control animals, or monsters, or anything... this should allow you to tailor a directional movement curve to each.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>&#34;True Speed Calculation - Cosine&#34; Macro</strong></p><p>The True Speed calculation is used to reverse the effects of a specific modifier function, in this case the &#34;Cosine&#34; modifier macro above, for tracking purposes. Suppose you have a &#34;scroll to increase speed&#34; system. You will likely want to reference the character&#39;s speed as if they weren&#39;t slowed down so you can ensure they don&#39;t scroll-tick themselves above or below a certain threshold. With this, you can always use the player&#39;s actual, unaffected speed as a baseline. Either store it to a variable or use it as a macro!</p><p><br /></p><p>All of our macros are contained within the &#34;BML_P_MovementInputCC&#34; Blueprint Macro Library file, contained within the &#34;MovementInputCC&#34; folder. The macro comes with Pawn set as its parent class by default. Considering all of the functions are math-based, feel free to change this parent class to Player Controller or Character as you see fit. To use these macros in a pawn or character or player controller blueprint, simply search for the name of the macro you want to use in your right-click search pop-up. All of our macros are delightfully lightweight, mathematically-based, and there is more commenting than code to ensure you fully understand what is going on AND how to edit them to suit your own, individualized needs.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is the type of asset you can use in nearly every one of your projects!</p><p><br /></p><p>Speed Runners: Sorry in advance and we have nothing but respect for your craft.</p>",
