  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Collect creatures, solve puzzles! Play as 60+ creatures with unique abilities in a vibrant world and ascend the mountain\n<!--text-->\nIn Ryder, you’ll embark on a journey through a vibrant, low-poly world filled with puzzles and creatures waiting to be restored. As a Ryder, you can bond with over 60 creatures, each with unique traits that help you solve more than 100 puzzles. Explore four colorful regions, use creature abilities to overcome puzzles, complete your bestiary, and climb the Sanguine Mountain to fulfill your destiny.\n\n**Start Your Journey**\n\nStep into the role of a Ryder—an ethereal being with the ability to inhabit living creatures through a process known as bonding. You are tasked with restoring the souls of creatures hidden away long ago and must journey to the summit of the mystical Sanguine Mountain.\n\n**Solve Puzzles With Creatures**\n\nEach creature’s soul is stored behind a Sacred Site puzzle. Puzzles are solved by retrieving and intermediately using orbs from within the puzzle area. Strategically switch between your party of creatures in the right sequence to get the orbs to the Sacred Site. Completing a Sacred Site brings the creature back into the wild.\n\n**Discover Creature Abilities**\n\nEach creature in your party has abilities that are crucial for solving puzzles, but no two creatures are exactly the same. While many may share similar abilities—such as wind jumping, teleportation flowers, or freezing objects—their individual characteristics, like weight and size, make them uniquely suited to specific challenges.  Some creatures can reach hidden areas by fitting into small gaps, while others with heavier weight can trigger pressure plates to open new pathways. Understanding how each creature’s abilities and traits interact with the environment is key to mastering the puzzles on your journey.\n\n**Complete Your Bestiary**\n\nCollect 300 creatures, including special variants, and build out your Bestiary. Every creature you bond with strengthens your party and unlocks new possibilities for solving puzzles and progressing through the game.\n\n**Journey To The Mountain**\n\nExplore four vibrant regions, each teeming with distinctive creatures and collectibles, before embarking on your final climb to the summit of the Sanguine Mountain, where your ultimate destiny awaits.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- **Immerse Yourself in a Unique Puzzle Adventure: **Experience an open-world puzzle style blended with the creature-collecting genre.\n\n- **Play as Over 60 Creatures: **Control creatures of various sizes, each with abilities that reflect their region and unique traits.\n\n- **Solve Over 100 Puzzles:** Face increasingly challenging puzzles that require strategic combinations of creatures and abilities.\n\n- **Complete Your Bestiary:** Discover and collect 300 creatures, including special variants, to expand your party and unlock new abilities.\n\n- **Explore 4 Colorful Regions: **Journey through vibrant, low-poly regions filled with hidden creatures, collectibles, and secrets.\n\n- **Utilize Puzzle Accessibility Aids:** Toggle camera views for a clearer look at puzzles or activate the puzzle visualizer, which briefly draws connections between important elements on the screen.\n",
