Inspired by the beautiful music and timeless charm of famous JRPGs, this music pack will let you build memorable adventures for you and your players! Each track was carefully crafted to elevate your game into the shining jewel it was meant to be!\nCan you guess some of the games which inspired this pack?\n\nContent:\n-12 tracks  (10 tracks loopable)\n\nTrack Descriptions:\n1 - Hero: A Heroic Main Menu Theme. You can use it again mid-game when it's your hero's turn to shine! \n2 - Shop Chap: A lovely tune to hum while browsing potions and equipment in a charming little shop.\n3 - Solace Town: A song for sitting on a bench watching in a peaceful town. But surely there must be adventure somewhere waiting for you! \n4 - Skeleton's Blink: Dare you explore the depths of this dungeon theme? What does it look like? Is there anything creeping around?\n5 - The Arena: Those who face challenges with courage and determination shall find their glory with this valiant theme! \n6- Ruins of Tomorrow: A sad mourning song. Hopefully nothing happened to that pretty little town. But mourn not, hero, a great journey awaits to right all these wrongs! \n7- Wizard of Sneaky Hands: In your quest to search for a great companion you found... uh, this person. Not the wizard of legend you were hoping for, that's for sure, but beggars can't be choosers. Comedic theme that works as a character theme too..\n8- Theme of Success: A short jingle to congratulate you for your great victory! (No Loop)\n9- A Good Night's Sleep: Because a well-deserved rest requires a well-deserved tune.  (No Loop)\n10- Legend: It has been a long journey, but now you can't give up. Despite the sadness, there is still hope in this song! \n11 - Battle Theme: Be it beasts or villains, your characters will truly feel like heroes with this battle theme backing them up! \n12 - Prelude: A bonus track. A softer version of the first theme. Ideal to tell a story. What is your legend like?\n",
