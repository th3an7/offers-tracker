  "longDescription": "The Empire has arrived. Their refugee fleet settles the rimworld, and seeks allies. Their honor-bound culture wields hyper-advanced technology, while bowing to the ancient traditions of kings and queens.\n\n# Imperial titles\nColonists can complete quests to earn honor with the Empire. Honor brings Imperial titles like acolyte, knight, and baron. Build grand throne rooms for your noble as they rise through the royal ranks. Dress them in finery fit for a monarch, or the prestige armor of a great warrior. They'll make speeches from the throne, inspiring your people, and play piano, harp, and harpsichord.\n\nEach title allows you to choose or upgrade an Imperial permit:\n\n+ **Imperial troopers**, **janissaries**, and **cataphracts** drop in to fight for you in times of need\n+ **Orbital strikes and orbital salvoes** blast your foes from above.\n+ **Shuttles** take you where you want to go.\n+ **Labor teams** help when you are shorthanded.\n\n# Psychic powers\nThere are multiple ways to develop psychic powers. Those who gain Imperial titles recive powers from the ceremonial Imperial bestower. Tribal colonists can commune with the mysterious anima tree to build their psychic link. Or, you can fight the Empire using stolen psychic technology acquired through quests.\n\nThere are a wide variety of psychic powers. Some are made for combat:\n\n+ **Skip**, **chaos skip**, **mass chaos skip**, **chunk skip**, and **wallraise** move people and objects across distances to gain tactical advantage. Extract wounded allies, cross no man's land, pull enemies into melee brawls, shift cover where you want it.\n+ **Painblock** and **focus** modify the mind for combat.\n+ **Blinding pulse** and **vertigo pulse** blind your enemies or force them to vomit uncontrollably.\n+ **Neuroquake** overloads every conscious being on the map in a huge wave of psychic energy.\n\n+ **Berserk**, **berserk pulse**, and **manhunter pulse** drive people and animals momentarily insane.\n+ **Invisibility** prevents your colonist from being seen during stealth approaches or escapes.\n+ **Burden** and **stun** slow and halt your foes.\n+ **Smokepop** blocks line of sight.\n+ **Farskip** moves a group of your people across the world.\n+ **Bullet shield** creates a small temporary safe zone for attack or retreat.\n+ **Flashstorm** calls down a storm of lightning.\n+ **Waterskip** showers fires with extinguishing water.\n+ **Beckon** mind-controls foes into approaching you.\n+ **Neural heat dump** moves neural heat to an ally so you can keep casting.\n\nOthers powers are useful for community management:\n\n+ **Solar pinhole** creates a long-lasting source of light and heat.\n+ **Word of trust** helps recruitment.\n+ **Word of joy** makes people happy.\n+ **Word of love** induces romantic attraction.\n+ **Word of serenity** ends mental breaks.\n+ **Word of inspiration** confers creative energy.\n\n+ **Titled** colonists meditate on their thrones according to Imperial tradition.\n+ **Tribal** colonists meditate directly in nature, to the anima tree itself or to constructed shrines or ancient stones.\n+ **Morbid** colonists with psychopath, cannibal, or bloodlust traits meditate to graves. It's more effective when the grave has a related person in it.\n+ **Ascetic** colonists meditate to blank walls.\n+ **Pyromaniac** colonists meditate to flame shrines made of braziers, torches, and campfires.\n+ **Everyone** can also meditate to sculptures.\n\n\n# Quests\nThis expansion adds a large variety of quest content. Since RimWorld is a story-generation game, quests aren't fixed like in other games. Instead, the system procedurally generates unique quests with every new game. Different goals, foes, guests, rewards, helpers, special threats, and world conditions combine to create endless varied stories and challenges. Quest givers may even provide special helpers during the quest - for example, a quest may ask you to fight a huge mechanoid cluster, but also include help from elite Imperial cataphracts to make the battle winnable.\n\n+ **Imperial hospitality** quests ask the player to host a group of Imperials. The guests may be injured or healthy, useful allies or helpless burdens, single or numerous. They may be hunted by mercenaries, pirates, mechanoids, or more. You might need to get the guests to an escape shuttle under fire.\n+ **Refugee hospitality** quests present a group of impoverished travelers asking for help. There are many outcomes. They may reward you later for your help, or betray you in the middle of the night. A third party may make you an offer to betray them. If you treat them well, they may spontaneously offer to join you. Since they have no faction, you can treat them with kindness or brutality.\n+ **Animal hospitality** quests see you caring for a group of animals struck with sickness or hunted by enemies.\n+ **Prisoner hospitality** quests ask you to keep prisoners under guard.\n+ **Shuttle crash** quests begin with a shuttle crashlanded near your colony, under attack by enemies. Quickly assemble a defense around the shuttle and help its defenders drive off the attackers while keeping the civilians safe, until the rescue shuttle extracts them.\n\n+ **Monument** quests ask the player to build a grand monument, and sometimes, to protect it from attacks.\n+ **Aerial assault** quests have you supply troops for an ally's airborne assault against a rival faction. A shuttle takes your troops into combat and extracts them.\n+ **Colonist lending** quests ask you to send some of your colonists to help an ally, leaving you to run the colony shorthanded.\n+ **Mechanoid cluster** quests threaten you with a mechanoid cluster at your colony, or at a site nearby, in exchange for a reward.\n+ **Other quests** quests present special combinations of raids, animal attacks, insect infestations, atmospheric effects, weather, and more, in exchange for rewards.\n\nA new endgame quest comes after you have climbed the ranks of Imperial nobility. Host the Imperial High Stellarch and his elite Stellic Guards in your luxurious court, protect them from their enemies, and be invited to leave the rimworld as an honored Imperial guest.\n\n# Mechanoid clusters\nMechanoids can now create mechanoid clusters - groups of new mechanoid buildings which work together to present a unique tactical challenge.\n\nMech clusters always appear in an initially dormant state. The player can take the time to decide and execute a plan of attack. This puts the player on the offensive, which contrasts with the defense-oriented fights in the base game. Mech cluster elements include:\n\n+ **World condition makers** that poison the air, darken the sky, or create some other world condition.\n+ **Shields** to block bullets or mortar fire\n+ **Factories** to assemble new mechanoids over time.\n+ **Beacons** to call reinforcements.\n+ **Turrets, mortars, and surrounding walls.**\n+ **Unstable power units** which you can attack to create explosions, or steal.\n+ **Alarm systems** of various types\n+ **Mechanoid defenders** including the new Pikeman sniper mech.\n+ **Gloomlight** units provide an extra reward if you eliminate the cluster with precision.\n\nEach mech cluster generates with a unique layout, presenting a unique tactical puzzle. Some of them will require a frontal assault. Others may be susceptible to mortar bombardment. You may be able to plant explosives inside the cluster before waking it up. A few can be defeated with a key sniper shot to a critical structure. There are many other tactics. Mech clusters can even be used to your advantage if you can lure foes or undesired allies into them.\n\n# Imperial technology\nThis expansion adds a ton of new gear. Some of them are unlocked through new techprints, which are special technology items acquired by quests, trade, or theft.\n\n# New combat equipment:\n+ **Jump packs** allow a user to fly across a battlefield.\n+ **Plasma swords** ignite targets.\n+ **Zeushammers** blast the target with an EMP pulse.\n+ **Monoswords** cut through almost any armor.\n+ **Cataphract armor** provides ultra-heavy protection.\n+ **Locust armor** is recon armor with an integrated jump pack.\n+ **Grenadier armor** is marine armor with a shoulder-mounted grenade launcher.\n+ **Phoenix armor** is heat-hardened heavy armor with an integrated flame launcher, for indoor flame combat.\n+ **Broadshield packs** deploy a local shield for tactical defense.\n+ **Prestige armor** comes in recon, marine, and cataphract forms. It displays status and enhances psycasting.\n\n+ **Kill thirst** weapons demand blood.\n+ **Kind or mad thoughts** affect a user's mood.\n+ **Jealous** weapons don't like it when you use any weapon except themselves.\n+ **Psychic sensitizers or foggers** affect a user's psychic sensitivity.\n+ **Kill-focused** weapons give instant psychic focus when they kill.",
