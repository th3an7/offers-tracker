  "longDescription": "The Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs campaign pack introduces a new brutal race, the Chaos Dwarfs, into Total War: WARHAMMER III, usable in both the Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns. \n\nExpand, exploit, and dominate the Old World as Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black, collectively boasting unique campaign mechanics, objectives, and units that only the corrupted minds of the Chaos Dwarfs could forge. With their own frightful agenda to pursue, they do not engage with the Ursun storyline in the Realm of Chaos campaign.\n\n•\tBurn it all down as 3 new Legendary Lords: Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black. \n•\tRecruit Gorduz Backstabber to sneak behind your foes as the newest Legendary Hero. \n•\tMaster chaotic magic with the all-new Lore of Hashut. Strike foes down with Hell Hammer or set them ablaze with Burning Wrath. \n•\tConstruct the Great Drill of Hashut to break open Hashut’s domain and siphon his blood for cataclysmic powers. \n•\tCo-operate with your fellow Chaos Dwarfs to obtain District rewards in the Tower of Zharr or usurp others for their Seats in your quest for supremacy. \n•\tCommand a comprehensive army roster of over 26 new units, featuring never-before-seen tabletop miniatures in the K’daai Destroyers, alongside some of the Old World’s cruellest infernal warriors. \n\n# ASTRAGOTH IRONHAND\n\nAstragoth Ironhand, High Priest of Hashut, is the oldest living Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer-Prophet. Once the most potent sorcerer to walk the Plain of Zharrduk in a thousand years, his powers have begun to wane and his body is slowly succumbing to petrification, negated only by the mechanical device that grants his body movement.  \n\nAs an armoured caster with a mixed spell lore, Astragoth zips around the battlefield at a respectable speed and can hold his own up close.  \n\n# DRAZHOATH THE ASHEN\n\nDrazhoath the Ashen, Sorcerer Prophet of Hashut, is the Lord of the Black Fortress and commander of the fell Legion of Azgorh. Exiled to the land he now rules, Drazhoath’s mastery of magic and engineering has only grown stronger. \n \nAs a mighty warrior and a powerful spellcaster, Drazhoath is a nigh unstoppable force, whether he’s splitting skulls on foot or scarring the lands mounted upon Cinderbreath – his Bale Taurus.\n\n# ZHATAN THE BLACK\n\nZhatan the Black is the Chaos Dwarf Commander of the Tower of Zharr. \n\nServing his master Ghorth the Cruel, Zhatan provides him with plentiful Labour and resources to fuel their growing empire whilst meeting his insatiable thirst for sacrifices. \n\nKnown for his high demand for weaponry, boundless cruelty, and greater stature, Zhatan is a bone-crunching powerhouse.\n\n# UNITS\n\nWith some of the most unique units in WARHAMMER III to date, the Chaos Dwarfs utilise their engineering prowess with Earthshaker-launching Dreadquake Mortars, Volcanic Magma Cannons, and Daemonic Iron war machines to pull their trains of destruction across the battlefield. \n\nOn the Daemonic side, set the lands ablaze with the monstrous K’daai Fireborn and K’daai Destroyer units; both bolted with heavy armour to contain a source of disruptive power never before seen in the Mortal World. \n\n# ECONOMY\n\nWith a multi-layered economy centred around the gathering and management of Labourers, the Chaos Dwarfs capture those that they best in combat and assign them to gruelling work in their Mining Outposts, where they harvest Raw Materials used to expand the Chaos Dwarfen empire, construct advanced buildings, and strengthen their armies.\n\n# HELL-FORGE\n\nWith the Hell-Forge at their disposal, the mighty Chaos Dwarf legions can grow mightier with special schematics forged in fire, and those schematics apply a set of bonuses to the allocated units so they may thrive on the battlefield.\n\n# TOWER OF ZHARR\n\nThe Chaos Dwarfs vie for ownership of special Seats within this mighty Tower, granting their faction unique rewards upon success. Chaos Dwarfs can also cooperate to complete Districts, benefiting the whole culture, or battle it out for specific Seats by usurping each other’s rule.\n\n# CONVOYS\n\nThe Chaos Dwarfs are famed arms merchants, supplying the forces of Chaos with weapons, armours, and war machines. By using Convoys, you can trade your tools of war in return for a wide variety of resources.",
