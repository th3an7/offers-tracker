  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Pocket Legend is 'Inventory' rogue-like deckbuilding game.\n<!--text-->\nPocket Legend is the story of a protagonist who is transported to another world where legendary weapons infused with souls exist. By strategically arranging various legendary items with unique abilities in the inventory, players must defeat enemies with diverse attack patterns that hinder their progress. This is an \"inventory\" roguelike deck-building game where the story unfolds as you overcome these challenges.\n\n\n\n**Gameplay Introduction**\n\nAs an \"inventory\" roguelike deck-building game, each card's ability is influenced by its position in the inventory, the surrounding situation, and relics.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe more empty spaces around a card, the stronger its attack against enemies.\n\nThe more obstructive blocks in the inventory, the more powerful the attack becomes.\n\nThe more you organize the inventory, the stronger you grow.\n\nSince you draw cards every turn, the gameplay offers a different kind of fun compared to games where you simply set up your inventory and watch the outcome. You must continuously reorganize your inventory each turn to find the optimal setup.\n\nThere are five main card types:\n\n- Weapon - Deal damage to enemies.\n- Armor - Increase the player's defense.\n- Skill - Trigger various effects that can immediately impact the battle.\n- Binding - Provide continuous effects just by being placed in the inventory.\n- Obstruction - Mostly created by enemies to disrupt your gameplay.\n\nThe core enjoyment and objective of the game come from combining these five types of cards to create maximum synergy. As you win battles, you can acquire inventory fragments to expand your inventory and obtain additional cards.\n\n\n**Inventory as a Cost**\n\nIn Pocket Legend, you can freely arrange tools within your inventory. The inventory itself acts as the cost system.\n\n\n**World Concept Introduction**\n\nPocket Legend features a wide array of legendary weapons, including Gram, Fridwen, Gae Bolg, Arondight, Levatein, Tyrfing, and Failnaught. These captivating legendary tools are imbued with souls, allowing them to bond with the player and join them on an adventure.\n\nThe player is transported to the world of \"Lumensia\" and gains the power of the \"Inventory.\" This leads them to become entangled in major events.\n\nCan the protagonists defeat the powerful enemies known as \"Tanebra\" and return to their original world? Play the game and find out!\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pocket Legend-13q91](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/9249e125a86146f3994e7549a04517f7/pocket-legend-13q91.jpg)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pocket Legend-10fr1](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/9249e125a86146f3994e7549a04517f7/pocket-legend-10fr1.jpg)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pocket Legend-1absa](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/9249e125a86146f3994e7549a04517f7/pocket-legend-1absa.jpg)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pocket Legend-1dybw](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/9249e125a86146f3994e7549a04517f7/pocket-legend-1dybw.jpg)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pocket Legend-1gfs2](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/9249e125a86146f3994e7549a04517f7/pocket-legend-1gfs2.jpg)\n",
