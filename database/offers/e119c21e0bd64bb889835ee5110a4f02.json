  "title": "Project Warlock II",
  "description": "Adrenaline-pumping gore retro funhouse that’s full of guns, magic, demons, vertical arenas, 3D visuals, 2D sprites, and heavy metal music. Inspired by FPS classics like Quake and Doom 64, Project Warlock II is the explosive boomer shooter sequel you were too shy to ask for.",
  "longDescription": "<!--image-->\n![Project Warlock II-1r4wp](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/99980c9e2c8e4ba6812642b418e25b3c/project-warlock-ii-1r4wp.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Warlock Evolved**\n<!--text-->\nProject Warlock II picks up right after the events of the first game. Warlock’s disciples Palmer, Urd, and Kirsten, each bring their own arsenals of skills, perks, unique weapons, and spells to the table, as well as personal reasons to confront their old master.\n\nLevels in the game evolved into vertical, three-dimensional, multi-floored structures, platforms, and buildings that literally elevate the gameplay. Each of the 3 chapters of Project Warlock II consists of 12 levels, each one more vertical and intricate than in the original game\n\n<!--image-->\n![Project Warlock II-b3gcy](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/99980c9e2c8e4ba6812642b418e25b3c/project-warlock-ii-b3gcy.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Explosive Combat**\n<!--text-->\nPalmer, Urd, and Kirsten carry unique arsenals of weapons and magic skills based on their personas that enable different playstyles. Their tools of destruction can be upgraded resulting in 20+ weapons for each character.\n\nIn the first chapter, don the mantle of Palmer, whose love for ice, fire, and dual guns fuels the fight against the demon hordes. Though little is known about his past, Palmer's lethal arsenal of weapons and magic makes him an unstoppable force against the endless waves of relentless Ghouls, towering Turbo Knights, flying Cacobots, and massive Pigdemons standing in his way, whether he’s raining down bullets, setting hellspawns on fire, or shattering them into pieces.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Project Warlock II-9fqq7](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/99980c9e2c8e4ba6812642b418e25b3c/project-warlock-ii-9fqq7.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nChapter 2 lets you experience the power of Urd’s magical arsenal and nimble weapons in the fight against demon hordes. Urd’s smaller, lethal tools, like the magic-infused Dagger, Buckshot Revolver, and TNT Charges, are perfect for dynamic combat. Her spells, from Agility for speed to Poison for damage-over-time and Crystal for battlefield control, give her the edge in battle. With her versatile weapons and magic, Urd is a deadly force, exploiting enemy weaknesses to master the art of demon-slaying.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Project Warlock II-d9189](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/99980c9e2c8e4ba6812642b418e25b3c/project-warlock-ii-d9189.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nKirsten’s campaign in Chapter 3 takes you beyond the stars, where cosmic horrors and unspoken threats lurk in the void. Armed with heat-based weapons and summoning magic, she thrives in chaos. Her Nailgun ricochets bullets off walls, the Lava Streamer scorches everything in its path, and her Demonic Claws tear through flesh and armor, feeding her insatiable hunger for battle. With Hellish Slaves at her command, and the crushing force of the Demonic Hammer, Kirsten bends dark forces to her will, searching for redemption… or something far more sinister.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Project Warlock II-1alsf](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/99980c9e2c8e4ba6812642b418e25b3c/project-warlock-ii-1alsf.gif)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **Old Meets New**\n<!--text-->\nThe legacy of the first Warlock lives on in the sequel! The goal with Project Warlock II is to take the gameplay you enjoyed from the original game and elevate it without losing the “Warlock soul”.\n\nThe ol’ and trusty character progression from the original Project Warlock is back in the form of Stats and Perks Points for you to find, scattered around the levels. Use them at the stations in the HUB - a level between the levels, similar to Workshop from the first game - and enhance your abilities to take the demonic carnage to another level.\n\nEach Warlock disciple brings a few unique upgrades, allowing them to show off the full potential of their respective arsenals.\n\nDuring your adventure in Project Warlock II you will find familiar demons, weapons and spells…\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# **KEY FEATURES**\n<!--text-->\n- 3 characters with their own arsenal of weapons and spells\n- 54 weapons and 70+ character upgrades to unlock\n- Customize your playstyle through Runes, Stats, Perks, Passive Upgrades, and Weapon and Ability Upgrades\n- Vertical levels - much bigger than in the first Project Warlock\n- 50+ types of enemies to combat - each with a distinct set of moves\n- 3D visuals combined with 2.5D sprites and pixelated effects for a true retro feeling\n- Heavy metal soundtrack, obviously\n- The sequel comes with multiple ways to save the game - auto saves, manual saves, as often as you want!\n",
