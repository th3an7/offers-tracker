  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# About Floating Isles DLC\n<!--text-->\nThis DLC unlocks a new singleplayer/co-op campaign that is playable with 1-4 players.\n\nThe campaign consists of 7 unique opponents, each increasing in difficulty. Floating Isles is the third campaign in Legion TD 2. The first campaign, Crystal Coast, is included with the base game.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Legion TD 2-addu1](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/29586d03c1c147569a1991a8616c1413/legion-td-2-addu1.jpg)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Overview\n<!--text-->\n- Prepare yourself for a challenge. Floating Isles is harder than Crystal Coast. However, opponents have prominent weaknesses that you can press to your advantage.\n- Approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay to complete the full campaign (Normal + Hard mode combined), depending on your skill level.\n- Every match is unique. The campaign is enjoyable to replay even after you've beaten it.\n- If playing co-op, only one player needs to own the DLC for everyone to play!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Features\n<!--text-->\n- Each opponent has its own playstyle, special abilities, rolls, and AI for building & sending.\n- Each opponent has its own soundtrack, dialogue, reactions, and voice acting.\n- The in-game Game Coach gives you hints for each opponent.\n- Beat an opponent on Normal difficulty to earn the first star.\n- Beat an opponent on any difficulty without any 40%+ leaks to earn the second star.\n- Beat an opponent on Hard difficulty to earn the third star.\n- Beware: Hard difficulty is designed to be extremely challenging, even for experienced players!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Floating Isles Opponents\n<!--text-->\nReek-a-deek:\nA mischievous rat thief who liberates the possessions of passers-by. Her Pack Rats gain extra mythium from treasure hunts, and she uses that to her advantage. On Hard mode, her mercenaries all cost 50% less mythium, but give -50% income, deal -25% damage, and have -25% damage reduction. Her economy is snowbally, but you can get fed off her weak sends, too.\n\n\nFabulous Freddy: A once-legendary wizard who is enjoying retirement perhaps a little too much. He always takes All Out Assault and sends a free Witch on Wave 11. On Hard mode, he now sends two free Witches on Wave 11. Plus, all his units have 50% increased mana regen. Take a defensive legion spell and build Magic damage dealing fighters that are strong against Wave 11's Natural defense.\n\n\nStormhammer: A rare dwarf, more at home in the skies than underground. Plays Grarl into Eggsack opening. Plus, in these fertile lands, waves 4, 9, 13, and 17 spawn 50% more enemies! On Hard mode, his flying fighters & mercenaries gain 20% damage and damage reduction. Will you try to break his egg, or scale your economy? Consider sending Fortified/Natural tanks as his builds tend to be Pierce heavy.\n\n\nJill McDonald: A cheerful nature-lover whose friendliness belies a competitive spirit. Plays Sakura opening. All your fighters lose 0.9% current health per second. On Hard mode, this is increased to 1.8%! Consider using healing to mitigate degeneration, and mount offenses on Arcane waves to exploit her Magic-heavy builds.\n\n\nRex Ribbitor: A smooth talking frog tyrant who exploits his underlings for the \"greater good.\" At the start of every wave, 30% of your current gold is...redistributed... to the royal coffers. On Hard mode, he also steals 5% of your hard-earned income. Perfectly fair, of course. Do your best to spend all your gold before the wave starts! Utilize Grarl if you want to save for more expensive fighters.\n\n\nchaoslord2468: The ultimate supervillain - at least in his own mind. Forces you to play Chaos along with him. Be warned: every wave you clear, your King loses 12% current health! On Hard Mode, this effect is increased to 20%! Plus, if that weren't enough, he also starts with 23 income. Try to pro-leak to keep your King from being drained, but it's a fine line between pro-leaking and leaking too much! Try to survive until late-game, where your Chaos synergies will pop off.\n\n\nDrachia: A godlike dragon with the power to cross between multiverses. All waves spawn 2x enemies, and everyone starts with a choice of extra resources! On Hard mode, your fighters attack 30% slower and have 30% reduced mana regen. Area of Effect fighters excel against the 2x waves. Just make sure you're ready for boss waves, too!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Why a DLC?\n<!--text-->\nLegion TD 2 takes time and money to develop and keep the servers online.
