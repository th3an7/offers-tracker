  "longDescription": "<p>This product is a kickstart for anyone looking at making a Real-Time Strategy game using Unreal Engine. This asset consists of modular elements that allows for any developer to easily modify and add to in order for them to jump in and start creating a game. To get a better idea of what that mean, please take a look at the documentation series as well as the listed features of this product.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>!!New!!</u></em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Modernized player input by moving to the Unreal Engine Enhanced Input system</strong></li><li><strong>Officially adopted support for UE 5.2 and 5.3 (5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 are now officially supported)</strong></li><li><em>5.3 seems to have better lighting and crisper effects for top-down complex/moving assets, the project runs much smoother and looks better when in motion</em></li><li><strong>Streamlined some code and removed some unnecessary complexity</strong></li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Wishlist:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Networked/Multiplayer Support</strong></li><li><em>This one is huuuuge, adding multiplayer support to the project would be amazing. Some of the framework is already built, but there is much work it be done</em></li><li><strong>Streamlined programmer/user experience</strong></li><li><em>Even though the code is modularized in a way that makes it easy to build upon and alter, it can be a daunting thing to look into the blueprints and see everything that is going on if you want to change some mechanics of the project</em></li><li><em>With that in mind, there has been a tremendous effort placed in making the code more readable and easier to digest</em></li><li><strong>Various fixes/bug squashing *Note: this item is perpetual, as it should be for all devs</strong></li><li><em>The main feature set, the Dynamic Fog of War, is running well, with no known bugs</em></li><li><em>Generally, the same can be said for the feature sets that are not the focus of this product, but bug squashing does occur</em></li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Walkthrough Video:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/KJyWwIveHZ0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here&#39;s my first walkthough video! It shows how to interact with the modular system, create new content, and import your own things!</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Videos:</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vtNWHMGBceE\" rel=\"nofollow\">Check out the showcase here.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#61;PLIVmZLGZk8bqQn5XbFPV25MSLPY-m6WVm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is the documentation series.</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Key Binds:</p><ul><li>Tab - Open and close the Build Menu</li><li>Q - Stop units</li><li>F - Unit abilities</li><li>WASD - Camera Movement</li><li>Alt &#43; Left Click &#43; Move Mouse - Change camera orientation</li><li>Mouse Wheel - Zoom in and out the camera</li><li>Backspace - Return the camera to its original position, press it again to return to its original zoom</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>About:</p><p>This system is easily altered with a few variable to enable to developer to adjust how the system works. There is a slight curve of vision on the obstructions that occur, this along with the distance of the unit&#39;s sight, the curve, height, and angle of the vision trace, can all be manipulated via variables. The system can be altered and moved depending on who and what you want to do the calculating.</p><p><br /></p><p>The other systems within the project can be altered as well, and these systems include:</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Health</li><li>Animation</li><li>Weapon/Projectile</li><li>Detection</li><li>Production</li><li>Camera Controls</li><li>Unit Hotkeys (Stop, Abilities)</li><li>Teams</li><li>Spawners</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>&#34;<a href=\"https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/aileron\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aleron Font</a>&#34; by <a href=\"http://www.dotcolon.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sora Sagano</a> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CC0</a></p>",
