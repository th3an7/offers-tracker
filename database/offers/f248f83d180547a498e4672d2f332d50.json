Support for macOS and iOS builds is planned for release in a future update.\nPlease note that builds to other environments are dependent on the Unity editor environment that each user has access to, as well as the contract status the user has with different hardware manufacturers.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n### Greatly Enhanced Character Animation!

Time to make your game look much better than ever!\nBy going to a higher native resolution, created games could be sharper, more colorful, and more vivid than ever! This is tremendous power in terms of creation freedom at your fingertips - and remember - all WITHOUT a single line of coding!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n### Not officially supported, but you can actually do these techniques...?\n・Rewriting the Source Code Through Unity Editor\nIn RPG MAKER UNITE, users can call out the Unity Editor UI any time as needed. Through this, users can confirm and rewrite a part of the source code however they see fit (Note: with the exception of some DLL files). This is especially useful for large-scale modification!\n\n・Using “Addons”\nIn RPG Maker series, users have always been able to develop and use scripts known in the community as “plugins” to expand engine functionalities not available by default. In RPG MAKER UNITE, users can use “Addons” to enhance and expand the engine. We changed the name due to how the internal processing works differently from past RPG Makers, but the concept and usage is identical. However, please do note that like always, we cannot provide official support on the development or usage of Addons.\n\nNote: RPG MAKER UNITE requires the usage of Unity Editor game engine.\nTo use Unity Editor, you must agree to the Terms of Service outlined by Unity Technologies:\nhttps://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service\n\n**■What is “Maker series”?**\nThe Maker series are game development software that dates as far back to the 1990s. We released multiple engines fitting different developer needs such as RPGs, Visual Novels, Action Games, and so on. While the past Maker titles were standalone software, we believe that with Unity's capabilities and our 30 years of experience in making visually forward engines, we can provide an experience that makes the game development process so much easier!\n",
