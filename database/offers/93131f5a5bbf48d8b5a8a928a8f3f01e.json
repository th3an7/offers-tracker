  "description": "The first-ever co-op Hack and Slash ARPG based on the Adventure Path, in which players lead iconic Pathfinder heroes into the depths of Gauntlight Keep and battle deadly abominations to reach the evil sorceress Belcorra Haruvex and end her vile schemes.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe wicked Belcorra Haruvex haunts her forsaken home of Gauntlight Keep. Centuries ago, she threatened the world with an army of monsters, beasts, and abominations, only to be defeated by four brave heroes. But her magic and malice have brought her back to the world as a ghost—and her army has only grown stronger in her absence.\n\nNow Belcorra is ready to take revenge against those who wronged her in life. Brave heroes are needed to venture forth into the undiscovered depths of Gauntlight Keep—a sprawling mega dungeon teeming with foul monsters—to defeat Belcorra’s army and put her wicked soul to rest once and for all.\n\nPlayers control and customize four iconic heroes of the Pathfinder universe, whose stories will unfold as they advance ever deeper into the dungeon.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-11nlj](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-11nlj.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-152h7](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-152h7.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nDelve deep into a sprawling mega dungeon beneath Gauntlight Keep. The Vaults are divided into several distinct biomes, each of which comprises its own chapter of the game. Each biome presents new foes, hazards, and abominations for the players to overcome.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-kjh4f](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-kjh4f.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-325sc](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-325sc.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-a6dnm](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-a6dnm.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nAmiri the Barbarian, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, and Ezren the Wizard. Each features unique play styles, abilities, and feats, allowing for deep Pathfinder-style customization.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-1k9ei](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-1k9ei.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nPlayers don’t just play one powerful hero - they control the full team of four! Players can stick with their favorite, and either switch to the other heroes when the time is right or deploy them to act on their own. For example, Amiri could kick open the door or be sent to hold off the enemies while Harsk picks the lock.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-1vl89](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-1vl89.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-11tj7](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-11tj7.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nControlling the entire team also allows players to take tactical advantage of each hero’s special strengths and even the odds against the abominations with powerful combos.\n\nSome combos are a 1-2 punch where timing is everything, such as Harsk weakening foes with poison before they face Kyra’s slashing scimitar.\n\nOther combos let heroes create something entirely new – for example, Ezren’s wall of fire becomes a flame vortex when Amiri spins her sword, a flame wave when Harsk swings his dual axes, or a wide-ranging fire dome when Kyra strikes the ground with her magic!\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-1sdg6](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-1sdg6.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-10p12](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-10p12.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nEach hero in Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults can be customized via various advancement paths. Players choose how to improve each hero's abilities as they level up to create the kind of hero they want to play.\n\nFor example, Kyra the cleric is a vital support character with her starting healing magic, but those spell effects can be altered to increase their range, add damage, or add additional protection, transforming Kyra from healer into a powerful blaster or a mighty frontliner.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-wengh](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-wengh.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-1w40k](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-1w40k.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nPlayers can join forces with up to 3 other friends in local or online co-op for a fast & friendly pick-up adventure - either right from the beginning, during a tough boss fight, or just because they’ve discovered a new part of the dungeon and want to share the experience!\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-b2uqi](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-b2uqi.gif)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-yv05j](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-yv05j.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults-69ejm](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/cbbbf6a2483b4145a9020ab38b45ed47/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-69ejm.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nPathfinder: Abomination Vaults is an epic adventure where cooperative play is key to defeating Belcorra's abominations and immersing yourself in the adventure.
