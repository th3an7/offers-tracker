  "description": "PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n**More than five years of DLC content in one massive bundle!**\n\nWhether you’re a new player itching to dive into the PAYDAY 2 experience for the first time, or a blooded heister looking for new adventures in crime, the PAYDAY 2: Legacy Collection will provide many hours of intense and exciting action. The content in this pack includes a massive amount of heists, characters, weapons, mods and cosmetic items, for an ever richer PAYDAY 2 experience.\n\nPAYDAY 2: Legacy Collection includes all paid DLC released up until December 2018, with the exception of the h3h3 Character Pack (a charity item which is sold separately).\n\n**Get Ready For An Epic Payday!**\n\n- Rob Banks, Get Paid\nPlayers must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\n\n- CRIMENET\nThe dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \"The Elephant\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\n\n- PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level \nFiring weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.\n \n- Dynamic Scenarios\nNo heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.[*]Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.- More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.\n\n- Weapons and Modifications\nA brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?\n\n- Play It Your Way\nEach job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.\n\n- A Long History of Additional Content\nMore than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.\n",
