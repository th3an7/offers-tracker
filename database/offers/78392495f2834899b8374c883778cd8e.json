  "description": "Free-to-play Third Person Action RPG Multiplayer Shooter set in the DRKVRS - a multiverse formed from fragments of corrupted reality. A world for outcasts who didn’t fit elsewhere, where every step might be the last.",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# DRKVRS World\n<!--text-->\nThe world of DRKVRS is a network of caverns, connected by mysterious passageways, which house Biomes - differing in resources, enemies, technology, and, above all, in the rules and conditions in which players must survive.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-x5ihv](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-x5ihv.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe biome to which information from Earth is copied is the one the player enters at the beginning of the game - the Nidus Biome. It houses Babalon, the Darkverse's largest city, where great politics takes place. In the immediate vicinity are the Outskirts - biomes overrun by creatures from other realities, with whom the Babalonians must fight for resources. Everything divides them, but they have one thing in common: they are all competing for the Blood of God, one of the Leviathan's precious resource.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# District no. 1\n<!--text-->\nDistrict no. 1 will be the first playable multiplayer location in DRKVRS. It immerses players into the story of Babalon, letting them explore its history and rules in DRKVRS world. This district is a foundation for the evolving full game experience and mechanics.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-1ks54](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-1ks54.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Game modes\n<!--text-->\n**Role-playing campaign**\nThe main gameplay mode is the story campaign. The campaign in the first Deathless Season is designed gameplay - one of its goals is to bring players to such a level of familiarity and involvement in the world of DRKVRS that in subsequent Seasons they will be able to consciously influence the development of the game and decide in which direction the forces ruling Babalon will turn. To a large extent, it will be the players who will create the development of events, which in turn will affect their further gameplay - they come to grips with the consequences of their decisions.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-2cjpb](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-2cjpb.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n**Maps & Instances**\nPart of the gameplay in the DRKVRS world is the exploration. Both the city of Babalon, which is the main hub of the Nidus Biome, and other, smaller agglomerations are primarily arenas for story quests and players' social and commercial activities. However, in addition to the cities in the DRKVRS world, players will also find semi-open maps - the Outskirts - full of dangers. In these maps, players will primarily explore sources of materials, fight enemies and complete story quests. Outskirts are generally uninhabited, dangerous areas. Their appeal comes from the resources that can be obtained there and the secrets that can be discovered. To survival in these unfavourable conditions is necessary to discover more hubs - agglomerations.\n\nIn addition to the story campaign and world exploration, the player can take part in so-called instances, which are PVE, PVP, PVPVE areas occurring in solo or group versions. Instances are repetitive challenges, during which the player can primarily test his skills and gain unique objects, items and materials.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-7lss8](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-7lss8.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\n**Time events**\nWhen copying and processing information from different realities, mistakes happen - copying errors. Then a unique danger arises - a mutation, at the same time being an opportunity to acquire unique resources - integrated information from different worlds, which should never be combined. Among them are the strongest materials, which can later be used to create superweapons, unprecedented armors and others. These are the so-called Saturnalia Minor - that is, timed events where cooperation and competition become extremely important at the same time.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-ohrsg](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-ohrsg.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Gameplay\n<!--text-->\nDRKVRS is a third-person shooter mixed with elements from role-playing games. At the beginning of the game, players create their custom avatars and join one of the four factions. The four factions include Hedonist, Barbarian, Technognostic and Nomad. Each of them has different abilities, weapons and gameplay style.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-f57i1](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-f57i1.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nA unique character skill development system - based on human archetypes and combat skills, allows for greater flexibility in building combat style and strategic team building in cooperative play. Players use development opportunities and an assortment of weapons, armor, upgrades and equipment modifications to decide their style of play and how to defeat the enemy. Players are able to upgrade their weapons and armor using materials they find throughout the world.  They can also level up, unlock attribute and skill points, which can be used to increase the stats of their avatar.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-17fgh](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-17fgh.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nDRKVRS is a dystopian world of violence and struggle for survival, requiring a combination of clever ranged combat and melee combat. During gameplay, the player visits dynamically generated locations from a pool, varying both in terms of enemies, bosses and resources to be acquired. In this way, a unique experience is created by the player, which directly depends on the choice of one of the paths, in a world of bifurcating story lines that represent both opportunities and threats. The gameplay can be challenging, while maintaining a varied level of difficulty, depending on the decisions made by the player. As the player progresses, the game's equivalent to gameplay difficulty will increase and give more chances to get high-end loot from defeated enemies.\n\n<!--image-->\n![DRKVRS-1ie2d](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/3a4bb7c631764b6cb8f4078e62b59f06/drkvrs-1ie2d.png)\n",
