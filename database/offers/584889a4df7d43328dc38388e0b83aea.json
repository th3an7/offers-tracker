  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n<!--text-->\nOccupying the northwestern corner of the continent of Xeryn, a desert older than the Calamity lies between the Brown Mountains and the River Lethe: the Bronze Desert. It is a realm torn by war in more than one way. The Empire rallies its immense legions here, sending them north toward the Green Continent to lay waste to its lush lands while the elite Chimera Legion remains behind to oversee this arid staging ground. Deep in the desert, however, lurks a different threat – that of the Ahari. Birthed by the native Bandul and tempered by their unwillingness to yield in the face of Imperial oppression, the Ahari seek to win back their sacred oases and holy sites, fighting an impossible campaign of terror. Amidst it all are the Handjari, sworn allies of the Empire and stewards of the greatest city in all the Bronze Desert – Kabur, the Jewel of the North.\n\nThe stage is set, the stakes are high. Who will you, a mere vagrus, align yourself with? The mysterious Ahari and their Sun God or the cruel Chimera Legion and their ruthlessly pragmatic leader, the Legate? Your decisions will shape the fate of the region writ large, paving the way for a new, uncertain future throughout the Realms.\n\nAnd yet, dear vagabond, how will you reach such a land, cut off from the outside by raging winds and deadly geography? Surely, you will need to traverse the Realms in a new, peculiar way rarely ever used by other vagri.\n\nVagrus’s first expansion, Sunfire and Moonshadow, offers a new, vast region to explore complete with a swathe of new settlements, new enemies to conquer, new stories to be a part of, a large cast of characters, and new quests to complete through which the vagrus may make their mark on Xeryn. With all this, as well as the introduction of a central conflict involving three new core factions – the Ahari, the Chimera Legion, and the Handjari – the expansion features content roughly one-third the size of the core game.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# NEW CONTENT AND FEATURES\n<!--text-->\n- An entirely new, expansive region to explore and exploit\n- Fully fleshed-out, extensive questlines\n- New enemies, monstrous and humanoid alike\n- A large cast of new NPCs, with backstories, motivations, and allegiances to various factions or ideals\n- A core story and narrative arc that covers the central conflict of the region where players must take sides\n- The addition of three new factions (one major and two local), all of whom play vital parts in the Bronze Desert’s conflict\n- New equipment, items, and rewards for quests and factions\n",
