  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# About Desert Ridge DLC\n<!--text-->\nThis DLC unlocks a new singleplayer/co-op campaign that is playable with 1-4 players.\n\nThe campaign consists of 7 unique opponents, each increasing in difficulty. Desert Ridge is the second campaign in Legion TD 2. The first campaign, Crystal Coast, is included with the base game.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Legion TD 2-1fsvn](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/29586d03c1c147569a1991a8616c1413/legion-td-2-1fsvn.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Overview\n<!--text-->\n- Prepare yourself for a challenge. Desert Ridge is harder than Crystal Coast. However, opponents have prominent weaknesses that you can press to your advantage.\n- Approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay to complete the full campaign (Normal + Hard mode combined), depending on your skill level.\n- Every match is unique. The campaign is enjoyable to replay even after you've beaten it.\n- If playing co-op, only one player needs to own the DLC for everyone to play!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Features\n<!--text-->\n- Each opponent has its own playstyle, special abilities, rolls, and AI for building & sending.\n- Each opponent has its own soundtrack, dialogue, reactions, and voice acting.\n- The in-game Game Coach gives you hints for each opponent.\n- Beat an opponent on Normal difficulty to earn the first star.\n- Beat an opponent on any difficulty without any 40%+ leaks to earn the second star.\n- Beat an opponent on Hard difficulty to earn the third star.\n- Beware: Hard difficulty is designed to be extremely challenging, even for experienced players!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Desert Ridge Opponents\n<!--text-->\nEmber: A spunky teenage dragon. Dragon Turtles & Drakes are massively buffed. On Hard mode, they deal splash damage. You'll need a way to tank their heavy magic damage, or else you'll be burnt to a crisp!\n\n\nFather Juju: An old geezer who just wants to give you a \"good deal.\" Summons Dancing Snakes to attack you every wave. On Hard mode, they apply a powerful attack speed debuff. You'll need to play it safe to survive the early game pressure.\n\n\nPennyTV: A popular streamer who likes playing by her own special rules: she forces you to play only T1 (cheap) fighters, while she plays whatever she wants! You'll need to gain an advantage before your T1-only build falls off. On Hard mode, she starts with huge bonus income, making the challenge much harder.\n\n\nBonny Flay: A celebrity chef known for his love of salt. His Nightmare + Butcher opening is tough to crack. Plus, he complains to the devs whenever he leaks, and his units get subtle \"balance hotfixes\" as a result. You'll probably want to make a play on Wave 11/15, his weaker waves. On Hard mode, the \"hotfixes\" are no longer subtle.\n\n\nSven: A calm, but intense hunter. In his neck of the woods, bosses and mini-bosses have massively increased stats, so you'll need to bring a strong anti-boss lineup to match survive. On Hard mode, his own fighters deal massive bonus damage to bosses, so you'll have to find a weakness elsewhere.\n\n\nCrashton: A wild, racecar driving goblin. Pushes too many workers, but always seems to get away with it. Predictably sends almost every wave, but receives 15% more income than usual. On Hard mode, every 3 workers he trains, he gains an extra worker out of nowhere. You'll need to pressure him early, or else he'll scale to the moon.\n\n\nVictra: An advanced, alien AI. Her Gatling Guns are replaced with more powerful Annihilator units that attack at full-speed at any range and generate mythium with every attack. On Hard mode, her Annihilators generate double the mythium to unleash massive sends. Siege Rams can tank her absurd pierce damage, but that's about it. Try not to lose before then.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Why a DLC?\n<!--text-->\nLegion TD 2 takes time and money to develop and keep the servers online. Periodically releasing DLC's ensures that the dev team can continue to pump out monthly patches with new units, new features, balance tweaks, quality of life improvements, and bug fixes, all free of charge. Supporting the dev team with your purchase also ensures the game can continue running for many years to come, without any subscription fees.\n\nAs an additional thank-you, after beating the campaign on Normal difficulty, you will automatically unlock the exclusive Afterburner Doomsday Machine skin!\n\nThank you for considering this purchase, and we hope you enjoy the new campaign!\n- The AutoAttack Games Team\n",
