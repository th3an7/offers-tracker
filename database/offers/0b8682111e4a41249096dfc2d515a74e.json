  "longDescription": "# MASTER THE MACHINE\n\nConquer American mountains as you haul incredible tonnage with the workhorses of industry, get the British capital’s commuters to work in record time and race state-to-state aboard German high-speed traction. Play your own way with creative tools.

Combine precision and versatility with the Class 395 ‘Javelin’, Britain’s fastest train running passengers to and from London at 140mph. \n\n# EXTREME WEATHER\n\nNew volumetric skies bring a transformed atmosphere to routes, clouds roam free at altitude, casting shadows on the ground.
