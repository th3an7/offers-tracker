This opening will eventually unseal his powers.\n\nWaka, the young daughter from the Kumon family belonging to a clan of exorcists rebelling against Phantom, and Mikoto, who offered cooperation, tried to stop this conspiracy, but lost him just before defeating him. In addition, Waka's younger sister Nagi has been kidnapped by Phantom.\n\nItsuki, who yearns to become the hero of Justice, and Yuzuha, a ninja who once managed to escape Phantom's seduction, also joins the fight, and the 4 girls set out on a search mission to track down Phantom and save Nagi.\n",
