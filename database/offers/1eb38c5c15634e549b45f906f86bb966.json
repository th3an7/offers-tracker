  "longDescription": "# This DLC is not supported on Mac builds\n\n# Pre-order to get 10% off. Only available until January 24th 18:00 (UTC)!\n\nExpand your HUMANKIND experience with the Cultures of Africa DLC. Experience thousands of years of rich history from the world’s second largest continent, home to over 1 billion people and 1500 languages. \nCultures of Africa features six new cultures, new natural and built wonders, independent people, and over 15 new narrative events. \n\n# SIX NEW CULTURES\n\n_ Era 1 – Bantu (Expansionist) _\n \nThe Bantu expansion is a postulated series of major migrations of an original Ntu-speaking group from Central- West-Africa across much of sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nPick this culture if you want to grab a lot of land fast and early! \n\n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/1-1920x1080-33bdc9e1935c.jpg)\n\n_  Era 2 – Garamantes (Agrarian) _\n \nThe Garamantes emerged as a major regional power in the mid-second century AD. Their growth and expansion rested on a complex and extensive qanat irrigation system (known as foggaras in Berber), which supported a strong agricultural economy and large population. \n\nPick this culture if you want to get food from arid Territories!\n\n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/2--1920x1080-7167b9f1fd94.jpg)\n\n_ Era 3 – Swahili (Merchant) _\n \nThe rise of the Swahili coast city-states can be largely attributed to the region's extensive participation in a trade network that spanned the Indian Ocean. \n\nPick this culture if you have lots of coasts and want to take advantage of them!\n\n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/3--1920x1080-bc889707d0c2.jpg)\n\n_ Era 4 – Maasai (Agrarian) _\n \nA fierce pastoralist people with a Nilotic (rather than Bantu or Swahili) language. For the Maasai, achieving warrior status meant single-handedly killing a lion with a spear. \n \nPick this culture if you want to optimise your growth rate! \n\n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/4--1920x1080-f4762d5c6c60.jpg)\n\n_ Era 5 – Ethiopians (Militarist) _\n \nDuring the Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia and Liberia were the only two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonization by a European colonial power. \nTewodros II also centralized the military by creating a permanent standing army from its historical practice of temporarily raising regional armies to create a national army. \nBy weaving the natural cliffs and ledges into the creation of their fortresses, Ethiopia was able to fend off most colonial forces. \n \nPick this culture if you’d like to quickly catch up on military and science! \n \n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/5-1920x1080-02d23a6d22ab.jpg)\n\n_ Era 6 – Nigerians (Agrarian) _\n\n  Nigeria unites a wide variety of cultures under the rule of one state. Although built around the three main linguistic hubs (Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo), the country brings together speakers of more than 450 languages. The variety of its terrain and the abundance of its hydraulic resources offer it significant agricultural possibilities and make it one of West Africa’s foremost producers.\n\nPick this culture to increase your oil deposits and agricultural workforce!\n\n![](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/6-1920x1080-5f49e29733af.jpg) \n\n# 5 NEW WONDERS \n\n•\tMount Kilimanjaro \n•\tVictoria Falls \n•\tZuma Rock \n•\tLake Natron \n•\tGreat Mosque of Djenné\n\n\n# PLUS 7 INDEPENDENT PEOPLE & 15 NEW NARRATIVE EVENTS ",
