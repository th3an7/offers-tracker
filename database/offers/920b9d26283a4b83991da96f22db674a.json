  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# ABOUT THIS GAME\n<!--text-->\nShadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a real-time stealth strategy game set in a fantastical version of the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. A place of mystery and wonder, these islands are home to pirates, vagrants, and all manner of strange folk – but the forces of the Inquisition have set their sights on these isles you call home, and will stop at nothing to eradicate your people as they seek a powerful pirate artifact buried in the region. Recruit and lead an undead pirate crew from aboard your ghost ship to outwit your enemy, striking from the shadows with both blade and sorcery to save your people.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-5gk86](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-5gk86.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-eh58e](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-eh58e.jpg)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nTake charge of an infamous pirate ship and reunite its cursed crew as you fight back against the Inquisition across the multiple islands that dot the region. With eight undead crew members waiting to be revived, you can choose who to recruit to your cause, and when – there are no wrong choices, but your crew’s composition will determine how you traverse the islands, your unique experience through the narrative campaign, and what abilities you have at your disposal at any given time.\n\n- Each of your eight shipmates is an individual armed with their own unique supernatural powers and mildly unhinged personalities – use these to your advantage in clever and creative ways to overcome obstacles and enemies. Will you bring Gaëlle and her magical cannon to launch friends over walls and chasms, or will you rely on Mr. Mercury’s ability to bypass obstacles from below? Or perhaps von Presswald can simply possess an enemy guard, use him to unlock the gates, and stand idly by as the rest of your motley crew walks in? Use these and other abilities individually and in tandem, timing their executions to orchestrate intricate maneuvers and attacks against overwhelming odds.\n- Mix and match your crew's abilities to find your preferred playstyle among the countless synergies that you can deploy against the Inquisition. Each person’s skills are tailored to specific archetypes built around manipulating movement, operating behind enemy lines, hiding the bodies of dispatched enemies, or being particularly capable killers. Missions will limit how many crew members you can take with you, so choose your comrades wisely based on their abilities and limitations.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-h3mho](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-h3mho.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-1b1gy](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-1b1gy.jpg)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nThe forces of the Inquisition are numerous and well-armed, easily able to overwhelm your crew in a fair fight – make use of cover, darkness, and magic to neutralize your opponents without being seen as you traverse the many islands to accomplish your objectives.\n\n- Missions span across entire islands in the Lost Caribbean, and not only can you choose the order in which you tackle those missions, but you’ll also have the choice of where to arrive ashore and depart once the deed is done. Will you prioritize safety, targeting less patrolled areas that may be more distant from your objectives? Or will you seek to make haste, arriving at and leaving from more heavily guarded parts of the island to be closer to your objective from start to finish?\n- The various types of enemies have different strengths and weaknesses, each warranting varied strategies – what may easily distract or defeat one foe may have no effect on another adversary. From the lowly footman to the snipers hiding on high all the way to the magically linked pairs of enemies who must be killed in tandem, your foe will always seek new ways to thwart you, pushing you towards inventive new solutions.\n- Keep an eye on your enemies’ movements and lines of sight as you navigate the light and shadow, and make sure no-one is watching when you make that killing blow. Your crew’s abilities can complement your surroundings, as well as open up new strategies not otherwise available. Nowhere to hide? Suledie’s magic can create cover anywhere, allowing you to get even closer for the kill, or sneak past any watchful eyes undetected. Particularly attentive guards watching a path from above? Gaëlle’s cannon can launch friends (and foes) to land onto them, knocking them out at the same time.\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-18i9r](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-18i9r.png)\n\n<!--image-->\n![Shadow Gambit - The Cursed Crew-lurrh](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/spt-assets/04fe02862c1b48aea2d2f79d9e3eff47/shadow-gambit--the-cursed-crew-lurrh.png)\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nYour ship will be your home between missions – a place where you can engage in your crew mates’ personal stories and side-quests, and perhaps more importantly, where you can make your plans to stay a step ahead of the Inquisition.\n\nShadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew takes a non-linear approach to storytelling – you can unlock new crew members in whatever order you please, and more islands get revealed as you make progress, each harboring multiple missions featuring different rewards beyond simple victory over your enemy.\n\nThere is no one designated path forward – missions always have multiple approaches available based on the team you’ve brought with you, but with such freedom of choice, there are many factors to consider. Will you temporarily avoid a more challenging mission to chase after a simpler one and gain more experience first? This may allow you to upgrade your crew’s abilities to more powerful versions that open up new paths. Or perhaps an entirely different, not-yet-unlocked crew member would be useful instead?\n\nThe Inquisition must be stopped at all costs – assemble your crew, learn their powers, and take the fight to the enemy, one island at a time. The fate of your world, and the lives of your comrades, is at stake.\n",
