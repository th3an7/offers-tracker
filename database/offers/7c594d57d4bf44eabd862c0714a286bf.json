  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# theHunter: Call of the Wild™ - German Shorthaired Pointer\n<!--text-->\nMeet your newest hunting companion. Just as its name suggests, the German Shorthaired Pointer is designed to point you in the right direction of your desired prey. On your command, it will leap and bound its way towards all but the largest of predators, making them much easier to target.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Find animals faster\n<!--text-->\nCapable of pointing towards animals of all classes with the exception of harmful predators, the German Shorthaired Pointer helps you encounter more animals and find their whereabouts quicker, delivering a more efficient hunting session.\n\nSome additional traits also bring extra utility, such as searching for a particular species after you've located and interacted with a clue associated with it.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Benefit from pointing behaviors\n<!--text-->\nThroughout your session, your choice of command will dictate the dog's search and point behavior. But one thing's for sure: you'll know immediately when it has identified a target animal through the stance it displays.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the German Shorthaired Pointer's different behaviors:\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nPoint S (small game): The dog searches within a close proximity to you. Upon finding a target, it will ‘point' in that direction and await your command before pouncing to flush out the animal.\n\nPoint M (medium game): Keeping its distance from you yet staying close enough so that its ‘point' can still be seen, the dog searches for animals within a wider radius. Game of this size will eventually flee if the dog ‘points' at them for too long, so make sure to always keep a good eye on your companion.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nPoint L (large game): For larger animals that won't be intimidated by the dog's presence, it will roam within a very large radius. It will signal to you when a scent has been found, guiding you in its direction.\n\nSpot Point: The dog will advance towards and ‘point' at an animal which has already been ‘spotted' by you.\n\nPoint Species (trait): Shortly after encountering animal tracks or droppings, you can direct your dog to search for the particular species that left the clue.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Train your expert hunting dog\n<!--text-->\nPlayers who already own the Bloodhound or the Labrador Retriever are in for a real treat. Through a free new update available for all dog owners, you can customize your very own expert hunting dog by enhancing one dog with the skills of two. For example, by combining the skills of a Pointer and a Retriever, you can train your dog to skillfully flush out birds and efficiently retrieve them after you've taken your shot.\n",
