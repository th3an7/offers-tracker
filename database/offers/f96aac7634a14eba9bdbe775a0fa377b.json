  "longDescription": "# The HUMANKIND™ Cultures of Latin America DLC includes:\n\n- 6 New Cultures – Caralans, Nazca, Taíno, Inca, Argentinians and Cubans\n- 6 New Wonders\n- 9 Independent Peoples\n- 15 Narrative Events\n- 30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy\t\n\n# 6 NEW CULTURES\n\n# Era 1 – Caralans (Builder)\n\nThe Caralan culture developed on the arid lands of the South American pacific shores at the beginning of the third millennium BCE. Here, they built a complex urban society where complementary communities of farmers and fishermen participated in the production of food surpluses that ensured Caralan prosperity.\n\nPick this culture if you want to rely on productive communities early on in the game!\t\n\n# Era 2 – Nazca (Aesthete)\n\nThe Nazca took advantage of the farming possibilities offered by their environment to build a perennial culture at the beginning of the second century CE. Experts in ceramics and weaving, they left incredible tokens of their craft and mythology in their numerous tombs and on the desert soil itself.\n\nPick this culture if you want to leave a strong mark on the landscape with numerous Emblematic Quarters!\n\n# Era 3 – Taíno (Agrarian)\n\nThe Taíno were affiliated to the Arawak speaking peoples and were dominant in the Greater Antilles between the 7th and 13th centuries. Endowed with great adaptation capacities, they took advantage of a wide variety of biomes, thriving through agriculture on lands relatively poor in animal and vegetal diversities.\n\nPick this culture if you want to optimize your growth and stability rates!\n\n# Era 4 – Inca (Expansionist)\n\nAccording to their mythology, the Inca were the heirs of Manco Capac who founded the city of Cuzco for his people. From the 15th century onward, they launched a successful series of conquests and integrated most of the Andean world in the Tawantinsuyu, the “Realm of the four parts”.\n\nPick this culture if you want to exploit mountains and have a quick access to every corner of your empire!\t\n\n# Era 5 – Argentinians (Merchant)\n\nAfter the proclamation of its independence in 1816, San Martin’s homeland played a decisive role in the destruction of Spanish authority in South America. After decades of political construction and conflicts, Argentina benefited from its integration into the globalized market to become a major exporter of agricultural products.\n\nPick this culture if you want to make your society an agro-industrial powerhouse exporting luxury goods!\t\t\n\n# Era 6 – Cubans (Aesthete)\n\nThe final capture of La Havana by Fidel Castro’s guerrilleros in January 1959 sanctioned the end of both Batista and the United States’ domination in Cuba. From this date onward, the combative resistance offered by the island to its neighboring superpower gave its people and leaders a tremendous international aura.\n\nPick this culture if you want to focus on alliances and send guerrilleros behind front lines!\n\n# 6 NEW WONDERS\n\n- Pyramid of the Sun - Teotihuacan\n- Maracana Stadium\n- Salar de Uyuni\n- Salto Angel\n- Lençóis Maranhenses\n- Atacama Desert\n\nPLUS 9 INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, 15 NEW NARRATIVE EVENTS & 30+ NEW IN-GAME THEMED MUSIC TRACKS COMPOSED BY ARNAUD ROY\n",
