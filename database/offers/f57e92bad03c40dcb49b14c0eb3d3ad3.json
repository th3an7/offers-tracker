  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# COPA CITY - HOST YOUR FOOTBALL\n<!--text-->\nYou've already been playing it on the pitch for years; you've managed your favorite teams to glory multiple times. But have you ever looked behind the scenes? Now, Copa City offers something new—a third side of football gaming. Step into the role of host, where the game is played beyond the field as you control everything to run a football event well before the first whistle. Boost profits, handle security, manage logistics, and turn your city into the ultimate football destination. \nSounds like a challenge, Hosts? Then here’s what you have to do:\n\nSTEP 1: ADAPT REAL CITIES \n\nThree real-world cities—like Warsaw or Berlin—are your playground. Each offers its own unique challenges, and it's up to you to get them ready. Adapt urban spaces, set up fan zones, manage media facilities, showcase sponsors, and—most importantly—prepare stadiums and plan logistics to ensure fans and teams arrive on time. Your choices shape everything before the match, so make sure you’re ready—after all everyone will see how well you executed your vision. \n\nSTEP 2: HANDLE REAL CLUBS. \n\nTop clubs like Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, Arsenal FC, FC Bayern, and others entrust you with taking care of their fans. Get ready to adapt to each club’s quirks including distinctive colors, chants, and fan behaviors that create an authentic atmosphere. Take Bayern Munich fans, for example, they prefer a quiet night before the game to recharge for cheering, while Flamengo fans enjoy lively late-night pre-game celebrations. Can you satisfy both? This is just one of the many challenges you’ll face in Copa City, so stay sharp as you manage all types of crowds—from families to ultras. \n\nSTEP 3: SET THE STAGE. FEEL THE EMOTIONS \n\nWhile most focus on the match, you know the real magic starts long before kickoff—in the atmosphere you create. This experience has to be enjoyable for everyone, not just the fans. Ensure you don’t block streets for locals and be ready for everyday life to interfere with your plans. Under strict time pressure, you’ll need to set up police modules, assign stewards, create family zones, and prepare the stadium—from the pitch and team-colored changing rooms to branded entrances and benches, and much more—to pass the match readiness inspection and keep the event on track. Only then will the city be ready to host the perfect football fiesta. \n\nSTEP 4: STAY ALERT AND GET IN CONTROL \n\nThe day is here. The moment of truth to see if your plans can withstand the excitement and chaos of a major football event. Stay alert as fan numbers rise and the city fills up. Small crowds bring small problems; big crowds bring big challenges. But hey, all you have to do is ensure the event runs smoothly from the start, react to daily real-time events and changing conditions, manage fan logistics to the stadium, and create great football for everyone. Easy, right? You’ve got this! \n\nSTEP 5: THE COUNTDOWN ENDS. THE MATCH IS YOURS \n\nYou’ve already put in the effort to make this moment happen. When thousands of fans flood through your perfectly planned routes and security checkpoints, you'll feel it- the Host's High. It’s that incredible rush of knowing you've orchestrated every detail to fit your vision like a perfect puzzle. What is a better reward for your job than hearing the roar of fans when players go out on the pitch? Well, making the next one even bigger.Your ability to orchestrate both the logistical and emotional sides of a football event will determine your success. So set the game, prepare the city, and let’s see if you have what it takes to create memorable emotions at the stadium, in the fan zones, and the entire city!\n\nOrganize matches in three distinct, real-world cities, recognizable by their landmarks. The Polish capital, Warsaw, will serve as the first host city, with two other venues to be revealed soon after. You will invite two out of six licensed football clubs to the city, an elite and diverse selection, which includes Arsenal FC, FC Bayern Munchen and CR Flamengo. They come along with unique colors, chants, features, and behaviors for their fans, creating an authentic atmosphere. But nothing comes easy. You need to ensure both safety and fun for spectators, taking into account the challenges that come with each club.\n",
