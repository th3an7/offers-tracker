  "description": "Easily implement on-screen and off-screen objective locations that display directly to your player HUD. With customizable parameters, you can add/remove specific objectives using trigger volume Blueprints.",
  "longDescription": "Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8p6x5qSVI0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8p6x5qSVI0</>\n\nThrough the use of textures, materials, and a handful of Blueprints, you can now implement a clean and responsive on-screen and off-screen objectives marker that indicates the direction and position of multiple objectives within your 3D level. Only actors can be added as objectives using these set of Blueprints; this includes Static Meshes, Skeletal Meshes, etc.; but excludes assets such as BSP.\n\nUse the BP_Objective_Marker_Initializer Blueprint to set initial objectives if there are any, and make sure that this Blueprint exists in each level or else the objective markers will not work.\n\nUse the BP_Objective_Marker_Volume to add or remove objectives from the player’s HUD, clear all objectives, or to only clear player added objectives if your game implements that feature. Using the eye dropper tool within this Blueprint, users can easily add and remove objectives dynamically within their level environment.\nIncluded in the BP_Objectives_Character Blueprint is the ability for the player to add and remove their own unique objectives dynamically by using the left-click to add objectives, and the right-click to remove objectives. \n\nAlso included in this Blueprint pack is a demonstration level named ‘Blueprint_Preview’ that demonstrates the functionality of these Blueprints, contains notes in the environment describing the functionality, quick tips, and more. The level environment was created using only the Starter Content provided to users by default when using the engine.\n\nThe art content included with this Blueprint pack is custom made and includes both materials and textures that can be interchanged in the BP_MarkerHUD if developers choose to use one over the other for their game.\n\nDevin Level Design: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/DevinLevelDesign\">https://www.youtube.com/DevinLevelDesign</>",
