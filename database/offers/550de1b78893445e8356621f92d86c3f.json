  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--text-->\nWar has ravaged Europe - but something far worse now grips the continent. A Bacterium of unknown origin has twisted the land, leaving behind only ruin, fear, and something far more sinister. In this PvPvE first person extraction RPG, players will scavenge a decaying world, face unspeakable horrors, and outlast rival survivors in desperate, high-risk expeditions where every step could be your last…\n\nAt its core, this is a deep, first-person RPG - one where your story unfolds through the high-stakes loop of a multiplayer extraction shooter. Progress from level 1 to 100 by completing quests, surviving Expeditions, and mastering a robust skill system that evolves with your choices. The extraction loop isn’t just a gameplay feature - it’s how you grow stronger, build your reputation, and gain access to advanced weapons, rare gear, bags, armor, cosmetics, ingredients, and other vital resources. Every Expedition shapes your path forward.\n\nPlayers can also choose a unique crafting or gathering profession, allowing them to create valuable items - whether for personal use, to aid their friends, or to sell within the player-driven marketplace. Crafting adds a layer of economic and strategic depth, rewarding specialization and community interdependence.\n\nWhether you venture alone or in duos or trios, survival demands strategy, nerve, and adaptability. The game features no wipe mechanics typical of the extraction shooter genre, ensuring your progress and story persist. Customize your appearance with cosmetics found as loot in-game, trade in a player-driven marketplace, and connect, quest, and transact with others in the social hub known as the Chateau. Proximity VOIP adds an immersive edge to every encounter - friend, foe, or something in between.\n\nAs players progress, the endgame expands the core extraction loop with distinct PvP and PvE experiences - including dungeons, boss encounters, and intense PvP combat - offering ever-evolving challenges for those who survive long enough to face them.\n\nPrepare yourself for a world where death is not the worst fate.\n\n\n**FEATURES**\n\n- Early Access launches with three large and very different maps, with more to come.\n- More than thirty weapons on Early Access launch with more to come.\n- Huge variety of gadgets, medicines and tools with more to come.\n- Unique hybrid of shooting and slashing combat.\n- Large variety of customisation, including characters, bags and weapons, the majority of which are acquired for free in-game.\n- Deep and permanent RPG skill progression.\n- Multiplayer hub world - the Chateau - to interact with other players, NPCs, Professions, quest givers and more.\n- Enormous build variety, with many viable playstyles.\n- In-depth questing and storylines.\n- Varied and engaging end-game content, including dungeons and boss encounters.\n- No forced wipes.\n- Proximity VOIP in Expeditions.\n- Gathering and crafting Professions.\n- Player driven marketplace.\n\n**FIND YOUR PLACE**\n\nIn the unforgiving World After the End, your survival and prosperity are intertwined with the denizens of the Chateau - a broad array of quest givers, shopkeepers, stashkeepers, bounty hunters and other Living. Completing quests and building your reputation broadens your access to new locations, abilities, characters, weapons, gear, and vital resources.  \n\n\n**INTENSE AND BRUTAL COMBAT**\n\nDeliver fire with a rifle or pistol, or lob explosive glass grenades with an experimental hand mortar. When the ammunition runs dry or the gap is closing too fast to reload, draw your axe or mace to enter lethal hand-to-hand combat. HUNGER is built upon a mix of methodical and frenetic ranged and melee combat as you enter a deadly and brutal dance with both the Hunger and other Living who seek to take what is yours. Find and equip armor, bags, trinkets, medicines, weapons, and shields to ready yourself for the different environments and battles ahead. \n\n\n**PROGRESS AND BUILD**\n\nWhile much of your equipment and weaponry may be lost, all experience contributes to progressing your Living and their level. Each of the Living has a set of unlockable unique Passive, Tactical and Ultimate abilities, alongside deep and extremely customisable mastery trees with more than 100 talents to choose from. Build your Living for stealth and solo play by quieting your footsteps and lockpicking doors. Specialise for ranged combat by quickening your reload speed and increasing your weapon control. Sacrifice your lethality and support your party by repairing their armor and healing them. Survival is the only measure of success. \n\n\n**EXPLORE THE PLAGUE-TORN LANDSCAPE**\n\nExplore forests, villages, monasteries, citadels, mines and more as you and other Living attempt to explore and plunder the remains of the World After the End.\n",
