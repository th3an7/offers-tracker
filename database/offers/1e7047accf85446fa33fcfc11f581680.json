  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# The Lost Glitches is a Techno Optimist Trading Card Game with RPG progression.\n<!--text-->\n**Play Your Story**\n\nThe Lost Glitches is what happens when a bunch of card nerds, storytellers, and artists asked:\n\n“What if a deck was more than a win condition — what if it was your story?” \n\nSo we built a world where your cards don’t just play, they speak. This is a game where deckbuilding meets character progression, where your strategy evolves as your avatar does. With layered RPG mechanics, open-ended build paths, and faction mixing that encourages experimentation, The Lost Glitches invites you to play with intention, and identity. \n\nThere’s no single way to win here. No perfect list to copy. Just a city full of memory-hunters, code-benders, and digital ghosts waiting to see what kind of story you’ll tell through the cards you choose to bring to the fight.\n\n\n**Immerse Yourself in a Cyberpunk World**\n\nStep into a world that feels like it’s been patched together from old code, forgotten dreams, and neon scraps. The Lost Glitches throws you into a cyberpunk universe buzzing with energy, where hackers are heroes, and memories are more valuable than currency.\n\nIt’s part card game, part RPG, all style, made for those who get a kick out of cracking systems and crafting wild decks. No hand-holding, no fluff, just you, your cards, and a city that’s alive with static.\n\n\n**Strategic Depth with Zero Hand-Holding**\n\nEvery match in The Lost Glitches is a mental dance — no gimmicks, no cheap wins. Just pure tactical thinking and raw decision-making. Build your collection card by card, shape your character over time, and grow stronger not because the game gave you a shortcut, but because you figured it out.\n\nProgression here isn’t dressed up in flashing lights. It’s slow-burn satisfaction. The kind that comes from unlocking synergy, pulling off a crazy combo you built from scratch, or turning a losing hand into a last-turn win.\n\nThis is for players who want to think, not just click. Victory’s never handed to you — it’s earned!\n\n\n\n**Skill-Based Mastery**\n\nThe Lost Glitches rewards true TCG enthusiasts who take pride in their strategic brilliance. Outthink and outmaneuver your opponents in matches that highlight your expertise. Experience the satisfaction of mastering a game that values your skill over chance. The Lost Glitches delivers for both Pilots and Builders alike!\n\n\n\n**Unmatched Stunning Art**\n\nLuck might hand you a win once, but The Lost Glitches is built for players who thrive on outthinking their opponents. Every match is a mental duel. You study the board, play the long game, and pull off wins not because the stars aligned, but because you earned it.\n\nIf you enjoy learning the ins and outs of every card, crafting smart plays, and watching your strategies unfold exactly as planned, you’re in the right place.\n\n\n\n**Grimy, Poetic, Indie Grit**\n\nThe art in The Lost Glitches isn’t just eye candy. It’s part of the code, part of the story. Cards don’t just sit there — they flicker, pulse, breathe. Every detail feels like it was ripped from a corrupted hard drive and stitched back together with neon thread.\n\nThis world is messy, strange, and beautiful. Exactly how it should be. \n\n**Creative Freedom Without Limits**\n\nNo rigid deck archetypes. No locked-in combinations. You build how you want.\n\nSmash together different syndicates. Stack up wild combos. Create something nobody saw coming. If you’ve got an idea that sounds crazy on paper but might just work — try it. Half the fun is in the experiment. The other half is when it actually works.\n\n**A Collector’s Playground with Real Stakes**\n\nThere’s something special about pulling a card that wasn’t meant to be easy to find. That rush, that moment. We get it.\n\nThe Lost Glitches is full of those moments. Rare drops. Limited editions. Cards that feel personal because they were earned, not handed to you. And soon, what you collect won’t just sit in your account, it’ll be yours to trade, show off, and take pride in.\n\n**Style Is Part of the Strategy**\n\nDecks don’t have to just function. They can speak.\n\nFrom avatars and card backs to emotes and effects, TLG gives you tools to make your style loud, subtle, or somewhere in-between. It’s not about showing off, it’s about making your presence known. When your deck hits the field, it should feel like you.\n\n\n\n**Start Your Journey **\n\nYou don’t need to know everything to begin. You just need curiosity and a little fire.\n\nWhether you’re here for the strategy, the collection, the art, or just to see what happens when you throw a weird deck into the ring, there’s a place for you in The Lost Glitches.\n\nLet’s see what you can do.\n",
