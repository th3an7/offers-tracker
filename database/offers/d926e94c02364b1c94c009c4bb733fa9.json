It's all there.\n\nEvery single one of the 200 sounds has been created and sculpted on analog hardware; that means real electronic circuits! They are unique and sure to give any of your projects a special flavour.\n\nWhile potential applications include any type of modern settings, space and cyber environments, you will find that many of the sounds could have very different uses, such as a monster growl or battle effects. Check them all out and play around with Pitch and Tempo!\n\nWhat this pack is NOT: Mimicking of real world everyday sounds such as a creaking wooden door, footsteps on concrete, birds chirping in the woods.\n\n●200 high-quality utility sound effects\n●WAV/m4A/ogg files included\n●Royalty-free for any of your projects\n",
