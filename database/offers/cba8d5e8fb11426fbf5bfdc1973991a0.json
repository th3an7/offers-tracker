  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Space Road: Elite\nTrading. Battles. To survive.\n<!--text-->\nIn order to jump into another system, you need to fly outside the system. Then select the destination system on the map, within the jump radius, and click the \"Jump\" button. To dock at the spaceport, you need to hit it at a low speed of 100 m / s.\n\nTrading is the main way to earn credits for the purchase of new equipment. To trade successfully, you need to buy the goods on the spaceport market that it sells. Then transport these goods to the system where they are bought and sell them there. Information about which products are bought and which are sold in each system is displayed on the map. The pirates' AI power is also displayed there. At first, you should avoid encountering pirates and not visit systems with a force of more than 200, you may not reach the spaceport. Purchased goods can greatly slow down the ship, so heavy goods (Uranium, Platinum) must be bought with improved equipment and traded between close systems.\n\nThe ship's equipment is purchased at the space shipyard. The ship's hull and all its equipment are divided into 5 dimensional slots I, II, III, IV, V. Each subsequent slot has twice the characteristics and weight of the previous one. To purchase new equipment, select a ship slot, then select the equipment on the shipyard market and click the \"Exchange\" button. The price difference is shown in parentheses. The atomic battery is running out and it should be constantly updated. The activated \"Smart Filter\" leaves only suitable equipment by type and size for the selected ship slot from the list of the shipyard market. The \"Ship Overview\" tab shows what changes will occur if the equipment is exchanged.\n\nThe main characteristics of the ship: Durability - structural points (health) of the ship. Shield - points of the ship's energy shield. Repair - the ship's repair rate is SHP per second.  Weapons slots - the number of slots for weapons. Support slots - the number of slots for auxiliary equipment. Speed - the speed of the ship. Acceleration - ship acceleration. DPS - damage per second when firing all guns. Move energy is the energy per second spent on the movement of the ship. Accel. energy is the energy per second spent on accelerating the ship. Energy of repair - energy consumption for repairs per second. Sooting energy is the energy per second spent on firing. Generation is the energy generated by a nuclear reactor per second. The charging rate of the battery, the energy of which is used by all ship systems. Accumulator - battery capacity. Mass is the mass of the ship. Jump - the jump range of the ship.\n\nIt is important to maintain the energy balance of the ship. The generated energy of the reactor must be at least greater than the energy of motion. During intense combat, when the maximum energy is consumed, the battery may run out. Then the energy will be used primarily for movement, and there may not be enough for repairs and shooting. A hangar allows you to have multiple ships and switch between them. In order to buy a new ship, you need to buy a place in the hangar. Move the old ship there. Then go to the space shipyard, select an empty ship slot and buy a new hull. Then buy or remove the old equipment, if the dimensions match. If you don't like the new ship, you can sell it at any time, the sale price is 90% of the purchase price. Equipment improvement has up to 4 degrees. Each spaceport has a technical level that determines the initial quality of the equipment and the amount of improved equipment. The quantity of goods on the market and, accordingly, the rate of exhaustion of the trade route also depends on the technical level. The galaxy is randomly generated. The generation core is selected at the beginning of the game. Aliens have attacked the edges of the galaxy. The goal of the game is to clear the galaxy of aliens. For a successful sweep, you need to have the best ship (for example, Cobra V Hmmm) and the best equipment purchased in technically advanced systems.\n",
