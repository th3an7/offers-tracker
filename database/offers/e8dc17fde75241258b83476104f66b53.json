  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Build your own gravship\n<!--text-->\nBuild your own ship and travel across the planet! Land anywhere you want to hunt for treasure, harvest food and fuel, and bring back souvenirs like exotic birds, long-forgotten gravtech, or a gold-plated charge rifle.\n\nYour gravship starts small - just a grav engine, a few rooms, and enough chemfuel to lift off. But over time, it will become a home: a travelling colony of labs, living quarters, workshops, and anything else your colonists need.\n\nCollect rare gravcores to expand your gravship and travel further. You’ll find them in crashlanded orbital platforms, insect-infested caves, broken-down reactors rigged with traps, and other dangerous locations.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Explore new biomes and landmarks\n<!--text-->\n- In the **glowforest**, bioluminescent mushrooms and psychedelic spores glow in the permanent darkness. Geothermal vents belch sulfur. Normal plants can’t grow here - you’ll need to survive on fungi alone.\n- The **scarlands** are the war-torn remains of once-thriving cities. Craters rupture the roads, vents release heat and gas, and toxic rain pours constantly. Mechanoids stalk the ruins and the only surviving animals are dangerous mutants.\n- The **grasslands** are a ranching cowpoke’s dream: endless fields of golden fertile land. While trees are rare here, the growing seasons are long and bountiful, and strong winds guarantee power for your turbines. However, drought can strike at any time and many farms have been lost to the raging brushfires.\n- The **glacial plains** feel prehistoric: blizzards smother the land, herds of mastodons roam, and scimitar cats prowl the frozen expanse. Carve shelters into walls of ice, or seek refuge among the buried frozen ruins and live as the old ones did.\n- The **lava fields** never stay still. Rivers of molten rock flow across the land in sudden bursts, swallowing up animals, buildings, and colonists alike. Volcanic debris crashes down from the sky, and thick ash makes it hard to breathe. Stay safe by building barriers to divert incoming lava and wear cloth masks to protect your lungs. \n\nThe new **landmarks system** combines with new biomes to create endless landscape variation.\n\n- Dig a sprawling colony into the rockface of **cliffs, chasms, crevasses, and valleys** for natural defenses - an undergrounder’s dream!\n- Build a coastal fishing village atop heavy bridges by settling on **islands, archipelagos, atolls, peninsulas, and fjords**.\n- Take over **abandoned colony buildings** and repurpose them for your own base.\n- Raid **ancient structures** for resources like chemfuel, weapons, components, minerals, and more.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Survive beyond the atmosphere\n<!--text-->\nSurvive beyond the atmosphere Fly your gravship into orbit! Land on collapsed orbital platforms, ore-rich asteroids, and hollowed-out satellites. Search through the debris for treasure, but be prepared for a fight with other orbital scavengers. Mechanoid wrecks promise advanced gravtech and resources for your ship, if you can make it past their ancient, inhuman defenses.\n\nSpace is a harsh place, so build your ship to survive. Airtight walls protect your colonists and their pets from the vacuum of space. Heaters keep the interiors warm, while oxygen pumps provide life support. Build airlocks with vac barriers to prevent depressurization of the ship, and equip spacefaring colonists with vac suits before they exit into the void.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Cute, terrifying, and intelligent wildlife\n<!--text-->\nOdyssey adds over 40 new animals that can be tamed, trained, traded, or eaten. Watch your colorful flock of sparrows and bluebirds take flight, raise a hunting pack of scimitar cats and great wolves, go swimming with seals and otters, or just keep the cutest ones as pets, like porcupines and prairie dogs.\n\nAnimals are more than just companions - they nuzzle your colonists to comfort them, they dig and forage for resources, and they’ll hunt down your foes. Even creatures with simpler minds can be trained by injecting them with a sentience catalyst - turning even the humble hermit crab into a vigilant protector. \n\nYou can also go fishing! Bring home big catches like tuna, marlin, and more unusual finds.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# Quests across the planet and beyond\n<!--text-->\nYou'll discover quests from ancient maps, passing visitors, and anonymous signals.\n\n- Track down the mythical **alpha thrumbo** by following its herd across the wilderness. If you can bring it down, its priceless, razor-sharp horn is yours.\n- Raid **ancient mercenary crypts** where the soldiers have recently awoken from cryptosleep. They  guard glitterworld supplies, and the gang leader owns a valuable weapon that could be yours. \n- Abandoned **orbital platforms** and derelict **satellites** drift through low orbit. They promise stockpiles of loot, but you’re competing with hostile salvage crews. Sometimes orbital fugitives hole up in the wreckage. There are also defensive turrets, traps, and leftover mechanoids. \n- **Asteroid mines** offer rich veins of plasteel, uranium, and gold, but they’re vulnerable to pirates and debris from space. Get in and get out, fast. \n- And more!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# New weapons, traps, and enemies\n<!--text-->\nA new **unique weapon system** lets you arm your colonists with special weapons they find - a sawed-off shotgun clears the room in a second, an AI-assisted rifle scope makes the worst shooter accurate, and a fully golden revolver just looks cool.\n\nNew gear helps with new threats. Hunter drones chase their targets and explode on contact. Wasp drones jab their prey with paralyzing needles. Ancient sentries patrol ruins with a scattergun to blast apart intruders. The cyclops mechanoid barrages enemies with shield-piercing gamma beams. And deep below, the insect hive queen stirs among her chittering spawn.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# The machine hive mind\n<!--text-->\nFar above the planet, the mechhive pulses with hate. Its mechanoids reproduce endlessly, and they will never stop attacking until every human on the planet is dead. When you reach the inhuman mind behind this terror, you face a choice. Will you destroy it and shut down every mechanoid for good - or take control of its power?\n",
