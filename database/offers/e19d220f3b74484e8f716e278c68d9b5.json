  "description": "“Strictly Combat” demo for KIBORG - upcoming 3D Slasher/RPG with rogue-lite elements. Play an endless arena with leaderboards and extensive progression between runs. Share your experience and help us make the game better!",
  "longDescription": "<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# ABOUT THE GAME\n<!--text-->\nKIBORG is an explosive mix of a brutal action game, an endlessly replayable rogue-lite and a narrative-driven time management game in a dark sci-fi setting. Send your clones on procedurally generated missions and build them into cybernetic gods in mere minutes as you cut your way through hundreds of blood-thirsty mutants, drug-addled criminals and mechanized soldiers. Gather resources for permanent upgrades, recruit allies, make alliances, research forbidden technologies and do your best to prepare for inevitable catastrophe.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# STORY\n<!--text-->\nYou play as Vasiliy - leader of a ragtag band of resistance fighters on a prison planet Sigma. Used to house the most dangerous criminals from all known star systems, Sigma is now locked into an endless quarantine after discovery of the Substance - an ever-adapting mass of rogue nano-bots infected by a malicious alien life form. A generation later, the planet is controlled by several factions fighting for domination.\nIn the beginning of the game, Sigma is shaken by an unprecedented event - a catastrophic breach of the Substance inside the planet’s only mega-city, housing not only convicts, but also management of various corporations operating on the planet. Everyone is a prisoner now. As the situation escalates and technical systems that control life on Sigma begin to fail, it’s every faction for themselves.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# GAME STRUCTURE\n<!--text-->\nIn KIBORG the clock is always ticking. Each mission you undertake costs you a day, regardless of its results, and every week or so, new calamity strikes. You must choose your actions carefully, balancing risks and rewards. With your every decision, with each victory and each loss, the story is moving forward. There is no “game over” screen to see and no previous save to load. You must learn to live with the consequences of your actions.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# ROGUE-LITE\n<!--text-->\nMissions are, for the most part, procedurally generated. You never know what enemies and challenges you’ll face. With dozens of enemy types, hundreds of combat modifiers and a plethora of non-combat encounters, no mission is the same.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# BETTER KILLING THROUGH TECH\n<!--text-->\nVasiliy uses a piece of future tech called The Cradle to send his clones on each mission. Even if a clone dies, Vasiliy stays unharmed. Clones are equipped with nano-skeleton, that can absorb tech from the fallen enemies and transform it into a variety of cybernetic implants. There are seven implant slots and eight possible implants for each slot. It results in thousands of possible combinations where no build is the same. And all these combinations are visual - they won’t only change how Vasiliy fights, but also how he looks - something that almost no rogue-lite has done before. And as if it wasn’t enough, there are also hundreds of augmentations - invisible micro-implants that take no slot - to fine-tune your build!\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# COMBAT\n<!--text-->\nWhen fists start flying, Vasiliy isn’t limited to cyber-tech only. The hand-to-hand combat is as deep, as it is brutal, with a wide variety of defensive and offensive options. Dodge, block and parry enemy strikes, mix different combos and special attacks, use your environment to devastate your enemies. Swing various melee weapons to gain a bloody edge over your opponents or just shoot them in the face with one of the many powerful firearms. But manage your resources carefully: ammo is scarce, melee weapons can break easily, defensive options drain your stamina while special strikes cost energy that you recharge with basic attacks.\n\n<!--textBlock-->\n<!--title-->\n# TAKE A MOMENT TO REST\n<!--text-->\nYour base is your fortress, a haven between missions. Chat with your allies (all with strong, eclectic personalities), listen in to their conversations or to news broadcasts, meditate in the garden, admire your collection of trophies, train in virtual reality. Or craft power upgrades to help you in combat.\n",
