  "longDescription": "\n# Set sail for new horizons with the HUMANKIND™ Cultures of Oceania DLC!  \n\n**The HUMANKIND™ Cultures of Oceania DLC includes:**\n- 6 New Cultures \n- 6 New Wonders \n- 7 Independent Peoples \n- 15 Narrative Events \n- New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy\n\n# 6 NEW CULTURES \n\n**Era 1 – Pama-Nyungan (Aesthete)**\nPama-Nyungan languages were spoken by groups who spread across most of Australia’s territory from the mid-Holocene era onward. Pama-Nyungan speakers brought not only their languages and social organization, but also new cultural and artistic practices as they set down roots.\n\n![Image \"Era1\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era1-1920x540-dbe7aaad73d8.jpg)\n\n**Era 2 – Polynesians (Expansionist)**\nDuring the first millennium BCE’s final centuries, the triangle formed by the islands of Tonga, Samoa, and Uvea was the birthplace of Polynesian culture. In this vast expanse of ocean, the Polynesians developed innovative navigation techniques—with which they set out to conquer the Pacific. \n\n![Image \"Era2\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era2-1920x540-a0e41a72495d.jpg)\n\n**Era 3 – Rapa Nui (Builder)**\nThe Rapa Nui colonized Easter Island around the 1100s. On this isolated territory, they managed to overcome difficult conditions to survive, make use of the land’s mineral resources, and cover their ground with monumental statues and ceremonial structures.\n\n![Image \"Era3\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era3-1920x540-fabe53c56880.jpg)\n\n**Era 4 – Māori (Militarist)**\nMāori populations mainly settled on Te Ika-a-Māui, the North Island. Here, they built a thriving and complex society, structured into clans and extended families, whose bonds of solidarity were maintained through conflicts and wars. \n\n![Image \"Era4\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era4-1920x540-b6867dc267b1.jpg)\n\n**Era 5 – Hawaiians (Agrarian)**\nStarting in the late 1700s, Hawaiian society entered a period of deep changes. Political unification and increased contact with foreign cultures transformed their highly stratified systems, even as Hawaiians continued to steward the bounty of both land and sea.\n\n![Image \"Era5\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era5-1920x540-2d7f71699255.jpg)\n\n**Era 6 – New Zealanders (Scientist)**\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, New Zealand accelerated its movement away from the British imperial framework. Over the following decades, its leaders widened the social model inherited from the Seddon and Savage governments, while also investing in technologies to ensure the country’s energy independence.\n\n![Image \"Era6\"](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/era6-1920x540-7ab947d9cf74.jpg)\n\n# 6 NEW WONDERS\n\n- Uluṟu \n- Aitutaki Lagoon \n- Bungle Bungle Range \n- Whakaari Volcano \n- The Royal Palace of Papeʻete \n- Mauna Kea Observatory\n\nPLUS 7 INDEPENDENT PEOPLES, 15 NEW NARRATIVE EVENTS & NEW IN-GAME THEMED MUSIC TRACKS COMPOSED BY ARNAUD ROY.
