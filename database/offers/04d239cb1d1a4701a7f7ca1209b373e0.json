  "longDescription": "Take command of the forces of light in the **Age of Wonders 4: Archon Prophecy **expansion. Join the celestial Archons as they strike back against Urrath’s corrupt forces. Consult the oracles, glimpse hidden prophecies that shape the fates of the realms and become the master of your own destiny. Contains a new culture, story content, and society traits.\n\n**New Culture:** \nBuild your empire with the help of the ***Architects*** — construct vast, magical ***monuments*** within your cities and dedicate them to the affinity of your choice to empower your economy and unlock powerful bonuses. Shape your domain and carve your ideology into the world.\n\n**Two New Forms** bring their eternal struggle to the soul of your empire: \n- **Elysian** — ascended, heavenly beings that bring a touch of the divine to your realm. \n- **Ancient** — withered and bent beings from the depths of history - and other, more sinister places.\n\n**New Narrative Content:**\nForge your destiny with ***Prophecy Traits*** — new society traits that help you shape your empire. Early in your journey a vision will appear, challenging you to define your ruler’s purpose and ambitions. How you interpret it is up to you, but fulfilling the Prophecy will unlock powerful rewards. \n\n**Two New Story Realms to learn the secrets of the mysterious Archons:** \n- **Rings of Emnora** - Enter the hidden realm of Emnora, stronghold of the Archons, in a search for aid in the eternal war against Urrath. \n- **Cliffs of Sordünn** - Land on the Coast of Sordünn and explore an ancient land that fell into the endless horrors of the Umbral Abyss. Reclaim the realm from Urrath's clutches and fulfill a Prophecy that will shape the war between light and darkness.\n\n**Four New Tomes:**\n- **Tome of Virtue** – Empower your armies with unwavering righteousness and bolster their fighting strength until the bitter end.\n- **Tome of Prophecies** – Weave fate into every moment with prophetic spells and omens that shape the battlefield.\n- **Tome of the Revenant** – Channel the power of the dead, and take vengeance against the living.\n- **Tome of the Archon** – Summon celestial allies and ascend your units to the ranks of Archons.\n\n**New Hero Class:** \nAnswer the call of the divine with the power of the ***Battlesaint***. Whether guiding the faithful as a sacred support unit or standing firm as a martyr-like tank, the Battlesaint turns virtue into strength and sacrifice into victory.\n\n**New Wildlife Units:** Face formidable new types of Wildlife roaming the lands.\n- **2 Celestial Animals** – Witness the soaring majesty of the Griffon and its even more magnificent counterpart, the Celestial Griffon.\n- **3 Archon Representatives** – Elite emissaries of the Archons.\n- **2 Revenant Archons** – Twisted echoes of fallen warriors haunting the world with their necromantic strength.\n\n**Additional Content:** \n- **5 New Music tracks** from composer Michiel van den Bos.\n- **2 New Mounts:** Chariot and Griffon.\n- **New Interface Skin** for a fully immersive experience. \n- **Several Map updates**, including a new pickup, a new ancient wonder, a new infestation, and a new type of region.",
